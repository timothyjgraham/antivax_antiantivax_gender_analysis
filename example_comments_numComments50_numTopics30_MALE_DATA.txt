I'm glad they feel guilt. Now what did you learn?

Love this. She "dropped in" to check on the courses and speak to the professors (although I doubt that med school professors actually sat down and spoke to some random woman about the courses they teach).  She acts like she signing up for night school classes at a community college. Does she realize there's more to the process of becoming a doctor (or lawyer) than just signing up for the classes she likes?  Oh, and you actually have to have a bachelors degree first.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, my friend's friend's cousin's twice remove aunt's grandson's friend of a friend's brother knows a doctor that can validate this.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
8 mths!!! No!! I had them in high school and it was bad enough.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As someone I once knew would say..."she's in more pockets than lint!"

They didn't go away; they just got bigger budgets and a global audience.

I hope he gets kicked in the face by a really big animal

Something as amazing as dick should not be anywhere near this woman's face.

That guy has more money than my entire savings... phewww!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This'll be touted as "based on a true story" soon enough.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
when I was little getting a vaccine was being around someone who was sick till we caught it :) once over the sickness you dont get it no more
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So sorry for your loss.  Thoughts are prayers are with you and your entire family
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm glad they didn't. You might be very boring if they had :P
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was really mad when my now ex wife took my son to her sister's house because her kid's had chicken pox. Then he got them. Turns out that was better then if he never got them until he grew up. I was still mad though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
thanks for clearing that up. the community nurse is trying t frce it down my throat that not getting the little one up to date will send me broke, she actually said that will happen.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well...if you think about all guys are in some fashion I fall to see how this am insult
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Our love & prayers are with you & your family. God Bless.

go home teach you don't need the school they need you. They get paid for each student they will cave.

Who has time to read about all that.  #monsatan   #shillbucks

It's worked for me also
Although it didn't help me win Wimbledon
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And to this day his mother is still waiting for her son to come out of the office. Some say that whenever a child goes into the doc you can hear someone say "did my son get his shot already?"

Well they won't prohibit it, they'll just recall it later.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Even if my father wasn't genetically my father, I'd still call him my father as he is the one who raised me. d=
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Never did shit for me but make me feel uncomfortable.  It actually made it harder to breathe because I didn't like the smell
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't remember the last time I saw someone die from a cut finger

Could only read half of that before I became choked with rage.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
i know i am missing a really funny story here...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I remember being in line along with my family, to get our polio vaccine and we were very glad to get it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She wants us to talk to her. She said 'please'. Don't censor her name!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Their coming to take you away, haha!  There coming to take you away, hehe!

If I burn my house down, then my house will never burn down again!

I just vomited in my mouth a little after reading that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why didn't he do all of this before it became a law?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My son got his today and my husband and I booked in for Friday!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hear about that guy that got hit by the subway in new york? Stupid guy got vaccinated! What did he think would happen?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hes a recker..hes gona pullout or run third party in the end to set up the dems to win.

So sorry for your loss Dr. Tenpenny. :-( I will keep you and your family in prayer. I'm glad to see the community pouring out their love and support for you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
LOL friend asked me if I knew what it was and when I said yes he then told me of another friend who went on a rant at him about it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I see a lot of home schooled kids on here
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As a fan of Lord of the Rings, I feel a little offended. ;)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Gave them my 2cents. But I think I would have more effect writing it on a restroom wall.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How long for? What's the best way to do it without burning the skin?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
NO!!! Most days I regret ever teaching my teenage boys to talk!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I had round-up coladas for dinner last week.  My foot fungus went away but now I can see sounds.  Is this normal?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I did have someone tell me once she didn't want to take insulin because she didn't want to get diabetes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But if one were in you... it would crawl out.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That must be why my doctor mom always vaccinated my brother and I.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
^-----  That's what I thought.  I didn't even realize this was a thing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I tried to explain this to a TEACHER and she wouldn't have it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I want to go home. It's late and now my eyes are bleeding.

"I'm not trying to take away their right to kill their kids."

0.o

1) Vaccines aren't "killing our kids"
2) I'm pretty sure killing your kids ISN'T a right
3) If someone IS killing their kids, I'd actually hope you WOULD try to put a stop to that
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sick sick. Sick, sick sick sick. Sick. Sick in the sick sick, sick.. won't somebody please get these people a thesaurus?!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Must be the fault of all the unvaccinated kids who weren't there.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is one of those reasons natural selection?  Maybe we should protect our children where we can.  Good gravy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My child is 2 years old and has an immune condition called XLA. He is one of the kids that can't be vaccinated and relies on a herd immunity. How do I protect him from children who have not been vaccinated?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The fact that these children were too young to be vaccinated puts even more emphasis on everyone else getting the vaccine. Maybe if more people around these children were vaccinated, they would never have contracted Whooping Cough to begin with
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ironically, the only people who would get infected from contact with an unvaccinated person is another unvaccinated person.  Right?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Look at it this way, if we avoided every environmental threat to our survival we'd still be lungfish
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How many would agree if one of her kids dies from a preventable illness?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If vaccines caused autism, shouldn't everyone who's been vaccinated have it?  What of those with autism that weren't vaccinated?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is there a vaccine to immunize against GMOs, or do you have to acquire that immunity naturally...?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can we give these people a little island that they aren't allowed to leave so they can see what really happens when you live off that holistic BS
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Mother of three? I feel sorry for her kids. Creatures like these shouldn't breed.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"I'm so happy to be able to help other gullible idiots not defend their children against easily preventable diseases!"
Fucking moron.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So you think a sick person should avoid treatment because doctors make mistakes and hospitals have diseases in?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she should put it on the invitation as a warning for unvaccinated parents to avoid HER home. I certainly would not want to go there.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In the Netherlands you get fined when you keep your kids away from school and child care will be on your ass.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she says "I would rather die than allow my child to be vaccinated."
hmmm ...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm against anti vaxxers because they are not trying to keep their kids healthy. They are trying to kill my kid and kids like him.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Farron Seajungle, some babies do have serious reactions to vaccines. Vaccines, like any other drug, does carry a small risk. However, if you compare the chances of being injured from a vaccine to being injured from the disease your trying to protect against, youll see why people choose to vaccinate.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You're right about one thing. It *is* all your fault that the child is at deaths door.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My dad lived through the polio age, most of my family is quite old so they remember when these diseases were a serious threat to the lives of not just children but everyone. And they all refuse to believe that some parents refuse to vaccinate.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I had Pertussis two years ago as an adult and it nearly killed me. I can't imagine how a child copes with it, let alone a baby. If Anti-Vaccers want to be all natural and unprotected that's fine for them, in their own gated communities, separated from the rest of us. I wonder if they feel the same way towards condoms? are they a dangerous form of protection as well?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
ALL vaccines are poison ! ......do you want to risk it ?

What about for your baby ?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would be scared to have a baby (too young to be vaccinated) in Marin county.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When you refer to the victim, why is it in quotes?  He may be fine, but he's still a victim of an assault.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think I���ll need it done in crayon, please.  The question is why *vaccinated* kids would be threatened by unvaccinated kids.

1.	The diseases haven���t gone away.   So where���s the threat to the vaccinated kids?

2.	Some people don���t vaccinate their kids.  So where���s the threat to the vaccinated kids?

3.	Unvaxed crotchfruit are more likely to develop disease. So where���s the threat to the vaccinated kids?

4.	Unvaxed rugrats mix with other unvaxed rugrats. So where���s the threat to the vaccinated kids?

5.	Unvaxed kids give disease to young unvaxed kids. This is a danger if the kids that get sick were going to get vaccinated eventually. But where���s the threat to the vaccinated kids?

6.	Innocent unvaxed kids get sick. This is a danger if the kids that get sick were going to get vaccinated eventually. But  where���s the threat to the vaccinated kids?

7.	No vaccine is 100% effective. Okay, here is a threat to vaccinated kids.

8.	Infect enough children and some of them will die. So where���s the threat to the vaccinated kids?

9.	All that suffering is the non-vaxers��� fault.  Okay , according to #7 there is suffering to the vaccinated child who caught something because the vaccine didn���t work.

From my reading, all except #7 outline dangers to *unvaccinated* kids.  I can't help thinking that the average anti-vaxer would feel that the list actually supports the original question.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think this go's a little too far, I'm all for vaccinating, but putting parents in prison for not is going to do more damage then good.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And, you know, cos vaccines are not magic. They prepare the immune system, but it's still in the end up to the immune system to fight it off. There is no magical 100% protection.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This child seems to also be one of the kids in the anti-vaxx meme. While kids (and some adults) may reasonably cry when facing a shot of any kind, CLEARLY this child was upset about something even more frightening to many adults.    ;-)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
lol.  So, don't vaccinate if your child might have a reaction,but we don't know if your child will have a reaction until you vaccinate.  And oh yes... <yawn>  that old "herd immunity"   wow
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's not about UNvaccinated kids, it's about mostly/partially/alternate schedule vaccinated kids
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No you're  not healthy not at all. You're severely mentally ill. Turn yourself in for assessment before you hurt someone.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Those who choose to be vaccinated shouldn't be worried since they believe they're immune against those who choose not to, right?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They've been pumping "vaccines" into kids for generations and are constantly wondering where all the illnesses come from. Maybe if a child was allowed to develop an immune system intead of being shot up or given antibiotics everytime they got the sniffles we'd have a healthier place to live.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I had all of those thing when I was a child and yes i was very sick for a long time but its a choice for the individual parents im for vaccinations but i dont feel the need to carry on like a 2 year old about it because its not my decision about other children and that is the thing you all need to remember
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No one should have to die or be put at risk because of religion.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The baby was likely unvaccinated, just like her babies
The vaccinated adults didn't get sick, weird...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just better hope we don't have an I Am Legend situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can you sue someone if you become I'll from their unvaccinated child giving you a controllable disease when you can get vaccinated yourself? What about when you can't get vaccinated? Or if it's an adult?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So the vaccinated kid nearly died, and the unvaccinated kid was fine? The vaccinated kid had low immunity, the unvaccinated kid did not. Yet they were both presumably exposed to the same strain. Am I missing something here? Perhaps the question should be why did the kid have such low immunity?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
@Janet highly doubtful. Sometimes parents get charged with shaking baby syndrome after their child dies days after a bunch of vaccines.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's a cute baby, I hope she doesn't get sick
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
i wish it would only effect them and not everyone else's kids. thats the only reason i even care. If it was only the anti-vaxxer in danger i wouldnt even care, let em die.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
trump kmows there is a problem and says so.  he mentions that he hears vaccines cause autism from parents and he thinks there is something to it.    trump is it for me.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think she means that these Chinese children were killed by vaccine and compared to that, autism from a vaccine is better.  :(
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So what deadly disease does the child on the right have? 
Make up something good.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I f you don't vaccinate (or even if you do) your child may get measles. If your child gets measles, he or she may be protected from asthma later on in life...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Vaccines are bad, because they'll make you ill... However, if you get ill, you're supposed to die, so just do it."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A school in my area sent out a message letting all the parents know a child in the school had contracted mumps, but not to worry as that child was fully immunized. Fantastic, lol.
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 3, '______________________________\n')
Correlation does NOT equal causation. You CANNOT develop autism, one must be born with the affliction.

I wonder if these women know what they are lining up for!!

Kinda puts the HCG Diet in a different light ?

Is there a correlation between HV6 and HPV6 and the number of cases of Glioblastoma?

I find this ironic because homeopaths are living in the 18th Century.

So it IS ketogenic but is NOT low carb? Well well isnt that interesting.

Help from a homeopath - what with the washing up?

"The difference between me and low carb zealotry, is that low carb zealots want EVERYONE to be on low carb diets"

So true.

Lol!  Whiter whites, virtually spotless, fresh frozen,
light yet filling, and now a "mild case" - How idiotic can people be?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The mistake antivaxxers make is not that correlation causes causation. They don't even have correlation to fall back on.

No, their error is to think made up stuff on Internet equals causation
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't let it scare you. These are all fear tactics which are being
used against you into forcing you to comply.

If A equals B, and C equals D, than E must equal Monsanto

i think the only way she will make it into medicine is as an exhibit

So that would be a fraction of a cell of a homeopath.

I don't have sex with men but I still have mine.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just have homeopathic sex, it will prevent unwanted pregnancies :P

They all want to move to an island together... we all want them to move to an island together... I think it's unanimous!

They also are not usually in the caution on vaccine camp.

Does it not need topping up from time to time
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Are they implying they give them more or fewer vaccines?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, because unlike a vaccine, injecting insulin could kill you. Unless you are a diabetic that needs insulin.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Great. Now, people will not want to take their insulin!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pregnancy is a contraceptive. While pregnant, you can have as much sex as you like without getting pregnant again.

Or maybe they cause clownism?

This so called Dr is the one spreading fear. In the end its gets people killed or grievously sick The reason that measles is not a prevalent disease is people are vaccinated for it!! The reason Polio is pretty much gone accept for some 3rd world country's, is because people were vaccinated for it. The same can be said about small pox and any other disease that is pretty much wiped off the map in modern countries. There is no fear but what this so called Dr is spreading.

I know how to prevent meningitis. Get a fucking vaccine.

is that strain used in a live vaccine that then could have been spread by a freshly vaccinated tourist?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
science has gotten better. We discovered more preventative measures for more diseases.

Does this brain doner even know what the symptoms of polio are?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Then there is also the idea that the fact we wiped out most of these diseases with mass vacation they don't really have a chance to mutate into something that is resistant to vaccines... but you get enough idiots not vaccinating and enough people get these diseases again and give them a chance to mutate so vaccines no longer work to prevent them... how many people are going to die before they can develop new vaccines to stop the new strains of these diseases

You don't "contract" shingles.  Herpes Zoster in your system as soon as you get chicken pox.  It attaches to your nerves.

In 1952 alone, during the worst recorded epidemic, 3,145 people, including 1,873 children, in the United States died from polio.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Immune system can handke vaccines? Then why do you need vaccines?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sure, maybe you could survive it - more likely to die a hideous death though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If the paralysis came from the vaccine. Then why were so many people suffereing from paralysis befor the vaccine was made?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not sure, but last time I checked, there were quite a few more people living in the USA than UK. So deaths per 100,000 would probably work out more, wouldn't it?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Whats funny is, the first immunizations against smallpox were mandatory for the British royal family

They'd take a smallpox scab, grind it up, and blow it up the patient's nose. They'd hopefully build immunity, or just suffer a small case of it(that they called chicken pox).

Sometimes it'd kill the patient though, they'd get a full case XD But mostly immunity
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thought polio has been eradicated? I guess not in the other countries. Luckily, I've never had chicken pox.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm one of those with no Hep B immunity,  the vaccine has no effect at all. ( on me that is,  for those too thick to parse a sentence. )
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Anyone who decides not to vaccinate owe people who do a HUGE THANK YOU! Because the people who vaccinate are the reason that people who choose not to vaccinate do not have polio, or small pox, or any other major disease!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Vaccines do actually harm a small percentage of the population. 

But just imagine what contracting the actual diseases would do to that small population.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I heard that vaccines, any of them, also can cause re-animation. Is that true?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And remember that epidemic and pandemic are statistical measures of spread, not how brain explody the disease is
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
One big reason; illegals with polio. Also TB, leprosy, and other diseases.

What is odd is how "sanitation" appears to have been re-invented multiple times during the last century, specifically for different diseases..
Like sanitation was invented after 1952 for polio, but only after 1963 for measles, and then only in the 1980s for HiB, and so on, and so on, experiencing multiple reincarnations.
Very odd phenomenon, this "sanitation" thing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The Guy doesn't know how vaccines work. Vaccines don't make you immune to it, they only reduce the severity and transmission of the infection.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
All you people are the reason we have disease outbreaks.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What is with AVers only being concerned with those who die?  Does the suffering of those that survive said diseases meaningless?  Since the existing approved vaccine prevents 70% of the cases theoretically you could eliminate 210K deaths a year globally.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
FDR had polio. Isn't that why he was in a wheelchair?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Like I said, letting the die is callus, but I think their death is all that will stop these people.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Jayson Smith, Cholera is almost unknown in Western Countries because of good sanitation.  Yes, I know the "sanitation explanation" is overused, but it is actually the case for cholera.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can we all smile when she dies of a preventable disease?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Actually, Small Pox and polio were wiped out due to the rise in use of herbal teas. Even those who don't use it were immunized by those who use it. :P
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
vaccines have been 100% effective, at erradicating smallpox from earth and measles, rubella and wild type polio carriage from the US.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Vaccination is natural immunity, just without actually having to get the illness.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Are they just looking at raw numbers not rates or what?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Clean water , sanitisation , good hygiene = no polio. Two vaccine induced polio cases is an outbreak , lol what a joke. Come on Bill Gates fill up your planes with polio vaccine and spray it over the Ukraine let it rain Polio.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I had measles, mumps and chicken pox as a child and never had a vaccination. Still here . . .
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Making shit up is a harmless childhood disease. Our grandparents used to hold lying parties before Big Pharma came along.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But... Polio is natural, why would you want to end it?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Come on down and get a shot, we will be happy to give you a dose of whooping cough or measles just put in your order
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You mean people DON'T want their kids to get preventable diseases?  Diseases that can actually be deadly?  Getouddahere!!

They. Do. Not. List. Autism. As. A. Side. Effect.   It's listed as a "possible adverse event" because the law is that everything that happens in the same time frame as a medication, get's listed as a possible adverse event.   It's like when you watch a commercial for a medication and they have a list of 97 things that may possibly occur?  That's everything anyone involved in clinical trials complained about while they were involved in the clinical trial.   It means that there are people who were diagnosed with autism in the same time frame as receiving their vaccines, nothing more, nothing less.   Why does this need to be repeated 9000 times?

The symptoms are pretty obvious, although so is the clear necessity of vaccinating your children.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"an unknown number of children".  Has it occurred to you that UNLESS the number of children harmed by vaccination is higher than the number who would be injured by the disease - and guess what, those who do their best to KNOW the number instead of just writing it off as "unknown" don't get that result - then what you're really bitching about amounts to "waaaaanh, the world wasn't made perfect for meeee!!"?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Removing vaccines would be a far more effective population control.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Except knowing what your patients take is important for understanding interactions and other things.

If vaccines were totally safe and effective you would not have to force them, people would demand them.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Only the very small number of those with celiac would benefit from this. All the "gluten sensitive" hipsters would just dismiss it as another gmo.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Closed facility testing could avoid this then, at a substantially higher cost and with less acreage I would assume.

I refused that one for the duration of 35 years in healthcare by using the declination form.

The Spanish flu circa 1918 was certainly good..... for undertakers.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Among other things, a doctor "fires" a patient, i.e., by referring the patient to another doctor or health care practioner, or otherwise dismissing the patient only if the patient demonstrates to be chronically noncompliant or otherwise is threatening or disrupting the doctor/practioner's business and or clientele.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well worth reading all of this. What concerns me is that no one knows the true rate of adverse reactions so it's ignorance that says "the benefits outweigh the risks."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you are in college, many college campuses offer certain vaccines at their health clinics 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There may be long term side effects but what is the alternative?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't question if there are grave side-effects to taking a vaccine with some.  There are even side-effects with some who eat peanuts.  The most important question to me is: "Do most vaccine scientists refuse to take the vaccines they approve of because they deem the risk greater than the benefit?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A second opinion doesn't mean squat because once you've been diagnosed  with a problem it's in your medical record and any other  doctor has that information available to him. Will they cut each others throats and give a different diagnosis? Some will but.....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's a simple solution.  Cancel their insurance and or deny health care to those that refuse.  It will sort itself out in due course.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This chart shows even with the difference in sample numbers there is a progressive benefit for vaccinated children

It's possible to be concerned about two things at once.

Thalidomide wasn't tested on animals during pregnancy & there was little control on medications given during pregnancy, lots of people suffered for this. If there's a 'good' side to this story it's the more rigorous testing standards that came about because of it.

The lack of self awareness in that post is nothing short of stunning
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As I understood his original position it was pretty open and just noticing factual effects on bee populations etc and asserting that we can't know long term effects of such methodologies and need to hold off on judgement and application until we can assess long term effects... how would a visit to Monsanto change that perspective?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
All of them - as long as they are not strictly synthetic.

Well, I am an almost qualified healthcare professional who specialises in medicines. And I disagree.

It mentions rape a lot.  Turns out it is a generally acceptable practice so long as you can afford to give up a goat.

Well, there's a difference between hybridization and genetic modification.  The point of extensive safety testing not being part of the hybridization process is a good one, however.

Oh I know it !!! It's all about the money has very little to do with your health and well being
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It is is not the vaccine per se that some people are concerned with but the reputation of the corporations who market them that are of concern.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is that nature or god?
One of them is real, and dangerous, if you don't approach it right.
The other is a made up fantasy, and  dangerous no matter how you approach it...

This should not be required in our future. At least not if we still have a republoic.

Exemptions should be available for one and one thing only. MEDICAL. And no. Not everyone has a 'medical exemption.' In fact, very few do. 

Vaccines are essential to keeping diseases in check!!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
one of our local libraries is in the same building as a community medical centre that offers vaccination.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have a similar concern. I'm concerned about shedding - specifically, the shedding of this individual's stupidity and ignorance, leading otherwise intelligent people into a life that is a net negative for society, and the potential for it to lead us into a never-ending nightmare of decadence and disparaging of science.

It might just be me, but I think that my concern has a much greater grounding in reality...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They already do, in far greater amounts than they complain about.

Screw health - I eat organic because it tastes better and, where I buy it, has usually done less food miles = better for environment anyway.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What if I don't want organic.. Then there is conventional and gmo.. Can't tell without a label.. Therefore forced to eat it
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Once I'm in a place long enough to try growing food, I'm going to have to use GMO seeds. Not that I feel strongly about organic vs GMO either way, I just suck at growing stuff. This is awesome and gives me hope! Congrats on your crops!

I love organic food. Or as my grandparents used to call it, food.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How about we label everything non -gmo . It is all gmo anyway so one way or the other shouldnt really matter
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think it is funny that anti-GMO people are against a bill that will enable food producers to certify and label their products as "Non-GMO" (Just like the "Organic" bill did a few years ago.)

I don't really see an issue here. Fresh food does taste better, and most foodborne illness isn't a huge risk unless you're immunocompromised.

To be fair I have quite a few more, but let's look at some of the 30 studies that were provided that fit your confirmation bias and let's see why that is (sorry to hog the threads here, but someone needs to teach Zumarrad some manners when she's off her little hobby home). 

Let's start with this one "Hepatitis B Vaccination of Male Neonates and Autism."

Interesting, you think this shows an increase in autism from just the Hep B vaccine?

This should successfully answer that for you: http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2009/09/17/another-weak-study-proves-vaccines-cause-autism/

Toxins are toxic substances produced by living cells or organisms- thus, mercury and aluminum aren't toxins.  Vaccines are also injected intramuscularly, so it's misleading to think of them going directly to the bloodstream.  Furthermore, thimerosal, the preservative containing mercury, has been removed in pretty much every childhood vaccine.  Aluminum is a necessary ingredient in trace amounts to stimulate an immune response.

��� 5,700 mcg aluminum (a known neurotoxin)
��� Unknown amounts of fetal bovine serum (aborted cow blood)
��� 801.6 mcg formaldehyde (carcinogen, embalming agent)
��� 23,250 mcg gelatin (ground up animal carcasses)
��� 500 mcg human albumin (human blood)
��� 760 mcg of monosodium L-glutamate (causes obesity & diabetis)
��� Unknown amounts of MRC-5 cells (aborted human babies)
��� Over 10 mcg neomycin (antibiotic)
��� Over 0.075 mcg polymyxin B (antibiotic)
��� Over 560 mcg polysorbate 80 (carcinogen)
��� 116 mcg potassium chloride (used in lethal injection to shut down the heart and stop breathing)
��� 188 mcg potassium phosphate (liquid fertilizer agent)
��� 260 mcg sodium bicarbonate (baking soda)
��� 70 mcg sodium borate (Borax, used for cockroach control)
��� 54,100 mcg of sodium chloride (table salt)

��� Unknown amounts of sodium hydroxide (Danger! Corrosive)
��� 2,800 mcg sodium phosphate (toxic to any organism)
��� Unknown amounts of sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate (toxic to any organism)

A lot of people know chocolate is toxic for dogs.  Very few know it's also toxic for humans.
The difference is dose tolerance. Human tolerance of the toxin in chocolate is MUCH higher than that of dogs - to the degree that it would probably be impossible for a human to eat enough chocolate for the toxin to take effect.

There are things that are toxic in such quantities (LD50 for botulinum toxin is 1-2ng/kg by injection) so you can't argue from quantity alone. However, we do know that thimerosal is rapidly broken down into ethylmercury, which is excreted quickly enough that there is no significant bioaccumulation or acute harm from quantities present in vaccine.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They are my children not the states. "No, no , no ! You will not inject them with?...Vaccines contain ingredients such as  MSG, antifreeze, phenol (used as a disinfectant), formaldehyde (cancer causing and used to embalm), aluminum (associated with alzheimer���s disease and seizures), glycerin (toxic to the kidney, liver, can cause lung damage, gastrointestinal damage and death), lead, cadmium, sulfates, yeast proteins, antibiotics, acetone (used in nail polish remover), neomycin and streptomycin.  And the ingredient making the press is thimerosol (more toxic than mercury, a preservative still used in many vaccines, not easily eliminated, can cause severe neurological damage as well as other life threatening autoimmune disease).  These vaccines are grown and strained through animal or human tissue, like  monkey and dog kidney tissue, chick embryo, insect cells, calf serum, human diploid cells (the dissected organs of aborted fetuses), pig blood, horse blood and rabbit brain.

What does vaccines and abortion have to do with each other?  I totally missed that.

Water itself is toxic as well. You need to drink about 1.8L of pure water in one go for a fatal dose, depending on salt levels in the blood.

Thimerosal isn't elemental mercury, Rosalie.  It is an ethylmercury compound that has been shown to leave the body rapidly (it doesn't bioaccumulate).  

None of the childhood vaccines have thimerosal in them, however, due to a precautionary measure in 2001.  Further research has never found a problem with Thimerosal.

Yup, don't use the vaccines because of the scary heavy metal ( an insanely minute amount of mercury ). Instead ingest a much larger amount of this other heavy metal... Derp!

Eating foods which have been sprayed with pesticides is no better than putting lotion on your body or using body wash with products which contain parabens or phenoxyethanol. They all contain chemicals which are considered toxins. They do damage to the human cells inside our body, period. Use them if you want but when you develop a degenerative disease do not act surprised.

Do you know the first rule of toxicology, Chelsey?  Of course you don't.

"The dose makes the poison."  

Water is toxic according to your ignorant thinking, because at high levels scientists claim it is toxic.  

Thimerosal, in the doses present in influenza multi-dose vials is perfectly safe and makes the vaccine safer.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So are they injecting cinnamon into their bloodstream? Sounds safe.

While it's true that is produces formaldehyde, the quantities are incredibly small. The oxygen in the air you breathe wreaks more havoc on the body.

Mercury is not an ingredient. Let's start with that. Vaccines do not contain elemental mercury.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Yet people like food babe list EDTA as 'toxic'. Ironic, since EDTA chelates heavy metal ions, making them safe
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They should inject them selves with 8 different ones and see how they react and some rat poison and some battery acid
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It does depend if the element/chemical/whatever bioaccumulates or not, for example: methylmercury (found in tuna) does bioaccumulate and is harder for the body to remove, while ethylmercury (in vaccines) does not bioaccumulate and is thus relatively harmless unless you inject like a liter or so into yourself all at once.

Vaccines can make children gay.

...

This is not how one structures a sentence to pose a question.

Can vaccines make children gay?

This is now a question. The fact that the article has been written as a statement demonstrates the articles intention. There is no scientific study being requested or funded by these people, just plain old fear mongering.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Science is pretty straight forward, a subject is studies, reviewed and accepted or not.  If vaccines are dangerous, show a peer reviewed study indicating it.  This Tenpenny person is just a rioter with no facts to support her, yet there are decades of studies showing the benefits and safety of vaccines.  Let's see a study to the contrary.

Well like I said you can find studies either supporting your cause or against your cause. It depends on who is funding the studies. Unfortunately we can't do anything about that. And that's what gets us no where.

Wow, maybe try putting together a single paragraph without using improper grammar all the time... Really shows his intelligence. -.-

A legitimate question by which standard? It is a totally stupid question.

Does that mean I don't need to have screws put in my ankle then?

hahaah so fucking true. I can name at least 5 people that do this when I argue with them.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The vaccine doesn't work so more people will go out next year and get it? Sure, that makes sense.

I caught the flu when I was pregnant. It took me down for a couple of weeks but baby and I lived..
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Do they have a record of how many kids died from a flu shot.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"$99 for 10 weeks or $10 a week" Wow what a saving!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Overreaction? NO. Stupidity.  Weeds do not warrant SWAT even if it had been weed.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Had to have a flu shot recently because of stroke, was also informed I can still get flu.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
at 60% on average every year if the flu vaccine was given to everyone, 4,800-24,000 people would be saved every year.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
All of my patients: "I don't need a flu shot. I got the flu shot last year and still got the flu."
No sir, you had a cold.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
We get our maintenance shots every time they are due.  Even seniors die from it very often.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think in basic alone I received 9 or 10 shots, and then 3 or 4 every year or so
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No flu shot, no worries, haven't had a flu shot in  over 10 years. Guess who hasn't had the flu since???? This guy! Me!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Last year's flu shot targeted the wrong strain, and only provided about 25% protection.  People didn't get the flu from the shot, they got it in spite of it!

If you are a healthy young adult I don't see why you would need abfly shot I haven't got one since I was 14 and also haven't gotten the flu since either
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just shows that vaccines are not all they are cracked up to be.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
... that's about why I don't use them and why I haven't owned one in years
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm 28 and never had a flu shot and have only had it twice.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You can't compare flu shots to regular vaccines.  Who knows, this woman may have had a bad experience where her body was sore for a week because of a flu shot and she wound up getting the flu anyway.  It could be due to a practical reason, not some  anti science one.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How does the compliant get sick if they took the shot?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Life expectancy was a lot shorter in the 30's idiot
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is what I'm scared of but I've been sick with a fever the last couple of weeks and can't get the shot! I'm hoping to get it this week before I give birth! If not, with my luck, I'll get the damn flu.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is that what one of the seven horsemen carries at the end ?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd share this with my friend who didn't get a flu shot and got the flu a couple years ago, except he's dead. From the flu. Like thousands of others.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I forgot to get the flu shot this year. A week and a half ago I came down with the flu, and today's the first day that I can actually get any work done.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
After a few days? How could that not be serious.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The last time I had the flu was the last time I took the flu shot...21 years ago...

I always get the flu when I get the shot XD
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Next year, I'll get the flu vaccine.  This year was hard on me, next year might kill me.

Exposure to SV40-contaminated vaccines are not associated with cancer incidence (http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/95/7/532.long , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15734981 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15286015 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15367569). 

If contaminated vaccines do not cause cancer, then it's safe to say that non-contaminated vaccines are not carcinogenic.

Surprisingly, a study in Canada reported that the rates of pervasive developmental disorders are higher among folks who are not exposed to thimerosal, once compared to people who get thimerosal inoculations (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16818529). 

Importantly, vaccines don't result in neuro-psychological/cognitive deficits (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23588083 ,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23847024 ,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20498176 ,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17898097 ,https://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hsph.harvard.edu%2Fpgda%2FWorkingPapers%2F2011%2FPGDA_WP_81.pdf&h=LAQFxvclO).

Vaccinated folks have lower rates of asthma compared to non-vaccinated people (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24461583 ,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19822573). Most studies find that childhood vaccinations don't make people more likely to develop atopic disorders (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23991838 ,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18266826 ,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16547964 ,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16368169 ,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15482514).

Not to mention, pregnant women who are vaccinated have better birth outcomes compared to non-vaccinated mothers (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24396098 ,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23378281 ,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20630123). Vaccination for pregnant mothers can reduce their infection rate by 89% (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22487092).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Joey, the cardinal rule of toxicology states that the dose makes the poison. The ingredients in vaccines are present at safe, low levels.

First of all, vaccines don't result in neuro-psychological/cognitive deficits (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23588083 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23847024 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20498176 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17898097 , https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/pgda/WorkingPapers/2011/PGDA_WP_81.pdf). These findings are supported by a prospective cohort study (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23588083). Basically, the strongest evidence concludes that the neurotoxins in vaccines are present at such low levels, that they don't affect neuro-cognitive functioning. 

At the end of the day, vaccines with mercury have not affected the rates of autism. Despite the reductions in thimerosal levels in vaccines, the rates of autism continue to rise (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12880876 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12949291 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3018252/). 

By the way, I found the articles that your link mentioned, even though I had to go to another website to get them. Around 22 articles... (http://www.activistpost.com/2013/09/22-medical-studies-that-show-vaccines.html). Finally, a challenge! 

Unfortunately for your stance, the studies supporting your stance are weaker compared to the studies that contradict their findings. For example, several of your studies analyzed small sample sizes (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12145534 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17454560 , http://jcn.sagepub.com/content/21/2/170.abstract). In contrast, studies that find no significant association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism have large sample sizes (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15342825 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15342824). 

To further illustrate the difference in relevance, this study of yours concluded that exposure to mercury from thimerosal vaccines increased risk for autism, and it had a sample size of 278,000 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18482737). Impressive. However, the largest study concluding that thimerosal vaccines are not related to autism had a sample size of over 400,000 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14519711). 

Overall, the evidence concludes that thimerosal-containing vaccines do not increase your risk for autism (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15342856 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23949514 , http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10997 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14519711 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19952979 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15342825 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15342824 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14595043 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3018252/ , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10376617). 

Sorry, you have lost. While you're leaving, take your petty insults with you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lillian, the vaccine and diabetes association is nonsense. 

Vaccines do not increase your risk for diabetes (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12182385 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11731639 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10526737 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9118767 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10895848).

Speaking of GMOs... In general, there's nothing dangerous or bad about the principle of GM foods and crops.

Genetically modified crops are not killing the honey bees (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18183296 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22868904 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23533634 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24039838 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22364780). 

In addition, Monarch butterflies are not harmed by GM crops (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11559839 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11559842).

Ultimately, most studies find that GM foods don't have a significant impact on animal health (http://www.agbioworld.org/biotech-info/articles/biotech-art/peer-reviewed-pubs.html , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19073230 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18787312 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17050059 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21967780 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17933942 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18029807 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24312218 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15570744 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22250399 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22155268 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3531449/).

Specifically, GM foods do not affect the reproductive system in animals (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23828972 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24012644 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24309144 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15053558).

Food acquired from GMO crops have not affected the health of the world-wide population, even after 15 years of consumption by millions of people (http://www.genetics.org/content/188/1/11.long , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2408621/).

Even the European Union has declared, "The main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than 130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25 years of research, and involving more than 500 independent research groups, is that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs, are not per se more risky than e.g. conventional plant breeding technologies" (http://ec.europa.eu/research/biosociety/pdf/a_decade_of_eu-funded_gmo_research.pdf).

Genetic modification is nothing new. While many people think of crossbreeding as natural, it is still - at its core - genetic splicing. Like it or not, hybridization changes the DNA. Name one crop that has never been modified in any way, by humans, in the history of us being farmers. 

The only difference is that when it's done in a lab, we know exactly what's happening at the genetic level (especially for species where the entire gene code has been sequenced), and are actually more likely to end up with the exact results we want.

Basically, there's no reason why the GMO discussion should be inundated with panic. Let's look at the GMO debate with a clear mind.

As Jay pointed out, there have been double-blind, placebo-controlled trials on vaccines - proving their efficacy and safety (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19962185 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20211953 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15794968 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20606533 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19574783 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11779396 , http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/123/2/475.full , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X08003708 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21060780). 

Still, you don't need double blind, placebo-controlled RCTs to prove the efficacy of everything. Where are the double blind RCTs proving that parachutes work? There are none, according to a systematic review (http://www.bmj.com/content/327/7429/1459). Who will volunteer for such a trial to confirm that parachutes work? Anyone? No? K.

The problem is when some folks say, "Cannabis oil cures cancer!" Obviously, they fail to understand that "cancer" is not a singular entity. Each type of cancer and location of cancer has completely different traits and modes of replication and survival. Therefore, cancer cannot be cured by a singular thing. It's tantamount to arguing that one tool can fix all car problems, which can't be done. 

In the end, the cannabinoids have mainly demonstrated anti-cancer efficacy in animal and in-vitro studies - low-tier research. No significant human evidence, no evidence. 

Still, the potential is there, but it's just that - potential. I find the available research interesting, though. 

Surprisingly, a study of two little girls, who both had brain cancer, found that they only experienced tumor regression after cannabis consumption (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21336992).

Not only can Delta-9-THC and the other cannabinoids kill some cancer cells, but they can inhibit tumor growth as well. Delta-9-THC and other cannabinoids have induced such anti-cancer actions in vivo - in laboratory animals and animal models (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23640460 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23349970 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19047095 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16818650 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21094209 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19425170 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17621270 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12511587).

When discussing the anti-cancer mechanisms of THC, it should be noted that Delta-9-THC activates the CB receptors. The CB receptors are linked to the ceramide de novo synthesis pathway in cells, and stimulation of these receptors lead to ceramide production, which then leads to cell death (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11165667 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19047095 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22879071 , http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/.../68/2/339.full.pdf+html - page 340 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3165955/ - Figure 1).

Fortunately, our healthy cells are protected by kinase checkpoints (safeguards), and some cancer cells lose those kinases as they age -- leaving them vulnerable to the apoptotic capabilities of cannabinoid receptor agonists, such as Delta-9-THC (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12133838). Basically, the cannabinoids don't kill the healthy cells (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14979873).

Overall, modulation of ceramide remains a key mechanism in which the cannabinoids can kill several cancer cells.

The cannabinoids could be effective in enhancing anti-tumor efficacy of conventional chemotherapy, and by reducing chemo-induced pain and nephrotoxicity (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21220494 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24117398 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19074681). It's unlikely that the cannabinoids would block radiation's anti-cancer efficacy (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24259678).

If we can get high-tier studies thrown in the mix of the available evidence, we could see if these anti-tumor effects are significant.

Pregnant women who are vaccinated have better birth outcomes compared to non-vaccinated mothers (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24396098 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23378281 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20630123). 

Vaccination for pregnant mothers can reduce their infection rate by 89% (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22487092).

Kelly, even if Wakefield's results were not fabricated, it doesn't negate what most of the observational evidence concludes. 

Overall, the observational research concludes that thimerosal-vaccines don't increase your risk for autism (http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10997 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15342856 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15342825 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14519711 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15342824 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14595043 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17508426 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3018252/ , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23949514).

The most recent, large-scale review - concerning MMR inoculations and autism - finds no significant link between MMR vaccines and autism (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22336803). Earlier studies also report that MMR vaccines don't increase your risk for autism (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19952979 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18769550 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18252754 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10376617). 

Actually, MMR vaccines may have prevented several cases of autism spectrum disorders (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21592401). A review of 120 studies concluded that MMR vaccines do not place you at risk for Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, autism or aseptic meningitis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12922131).

To quote from a 2009 review, "Twenty epidemiologic studies have shown that neither thimerosal nor MMR vaccine causes autism. These studies have been performed in several countries by many different investigators who have employed a multitude of epidemiologic and statistical methods" (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2908388/?tool=pubmed). 

The autism and thimerosal link weakens when we realize that Sweden and Denmark experienced major elevations in the rates of autism, which occurred at the same time when they lowered the thimerosal levels in their vaccines (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12880876 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12949291). Reducing levels of thimerosal has not affected the rates of autism, since the rates of autism continue to rise (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18180424 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3018252/). 

Surprisingly, a study in Canada reported that the rates of pervasive developmental disorders are higher among folks who are not exposed to thimerosal, once compared to people who get thimerosal inoculations (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16818529). 

Importantly, vaccines don't result in neuro-psychological/cognitive deficits (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23588083 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23847024 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20498176 , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17898097 , https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/pgda/WorkingPapers/2011/PGDA_WP_81.pdf).

Anti-vaxxers will continue to be obsessed with a potential link between vaccines and autism, that much is certain. Yet people who are familiar with the evidence have moved on to relevant issues. I recommend you do the same, Kelly.

I'm 80 and have avoided vaccines whenever possible (it is foolhardy indeed to allow such poisons as mercury, aluminum et al to be deliberately injected into a healthy body) but have NEVER taken a flu shot all my life due to my healthy lifestyle...whenever a doctor or another allopathic medical practitioner suggests a flu shot, I always tell them: "I take a flu shot every day by practising a healthy lifestyle that strengthens my immune system as an impregnable defense against flu or any other invading organism"...that shuts them up.

I'm also a retired history teacher with an M.A in history...thus, I have been trained to do thorough research on critical issues such as health and think critically...I read up on health issues every day and methinks I know whereof I speak.

I'm 80 and have avoided vaccines whenever possible (it is foolhardy indeed to allow such poisons as mercury, aluminum et al to be deliberately injected into a healthy body) but have NEVER taken a flu shot all my life due to my healthy lifestyle...whenever a doctor or another allopathic medical practitioner suggests a flu shot, I always tell them: "I take a flu shot every day by practising a healthy lifestyle that strengthens my immune system as an impregnable defense against flu or any other invading organism"...that shuts them up.

I'm also a retired history teacher with an M.A in history...thus, I have been trained to do thorough research on critical issues such as health and think critically...I read up on health issues every day and methinks I know whereof I speak.

Don't let the vaccine-pushers, the drug-pushers, the pill-pushers with a vested interest push you around...keep an independent mind, do lots of independent research on your own, and make up your own mind.

('\n____________________ TOPIC', 26, '______________________________\n')
Well, let's be fair: to really understand vaccines, it takes a lot more than "a little research."

But that's really the whole point though, isn't it? Anti-vaxxers don't understand science but they try to pretend they do through a simplified,  incorrect version of it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Like... Is this something that people actually think or is it just this one person?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
At this point in the debate, I'll either start sniping (which is fun) or:

The curse of "special knowledge" attracts her.  The idea that she has knowledge and understanding that no one else does is appealing to many, no matter how they get that "knowledge".
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
in her mind that might be correct, in reality it's the complete opposite
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm kind of bothered that it's "smarter scientists". Science is a little more complex than that.

Every one of you  says nothing but negative insults.  She said alot of accurate, intelligent things. Hmm.

You keep using the word science, I do not think it means what you think it means

Not everyone wants to / is able to farm, also small farms are much less efficient in every sense of the word.  I am not saying you shouldn't farm, but there really is no good reason why everyone as individuals should do so unless they so desire.

Also, what is that "people like you" comment supposed to mean?

Anyone who uses the phrase "settled science" doesn't know enough about the philosophy of science to be worth listening to. There is no such thing as "settled science" - that's the whole point of science!

Harley - I'm aware of that, but at this point I just don't even know anymore. You'd think anti-GMO people aren't serious at all but then you find out they are.

Frank, you spout lies and misinformation CONSTANTLY. You said people here have shown you to be wrong sometimes, but I've NEVER seen you admit to being wrong. Whenever anyone proves you wrong you ignore it and change the subject. Then you've got the gall to accuse people of not arguing with you because they're scared of you. We aren't scared, we just recognise the futility of arguing with someone who lies, deflects, makes ridiculous claims, and never admits he's wrong.

We learned this in high school science class. What baffles me is how many people I know, that have obviously graduated high school, are so ignorant? The stupidity baffles me.

this blows my mind.

it kind of makes sense though the way they assume any evidence supporting anything they don't want to be correct has just been manufactured to support the desired outcome. They seem to just assume everyone else operates the same way that they do.

Someone needs to explain to them how science is supposed to work.

you need to educate this man I know you could reach him if not I'd like to say some things to him as well  as the docks in the clip. If you need help and back up (bounce some ideas)  or just some one to address him  keep me in mind or just let him know whats up. I could be middle ground between you two to reach him without losing him, and maybe even get him to admit and get some truth out there?

You have not once on this page stated WHY you believe vaccines and GMOs are dangerous. Don't you find it strange that you come here, post dozens of times, but never explain exactly what your position is beyond just telling everyone else that they are stupid and you are smarter than them? How would you regard someone that came to you, refused to tell you why they believed something, and then just kept calling you an idiot for not listening to them?

To bad they weren't  making adds when hand washing was enacted.

If they're "pro-choice" when it comes to vaccines, you'd think they'd be OK with it. Well, logic has never been their strong suit.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The anti-vaxx movement is one big contradiction of terms, logic and thought.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They still haven't got a clue about the political spectrum.

There is a fire hydrant on my corner if I may assist some of you anti-vaxers with a colon flush. See? Pro-vax and anti-vax working together!!!!!

Allergic to peanuts and pro-vaccine.  When I get vaccines, I don't have an allergic reaction.  Weird.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I know, and reference the effect regularly.
Are you familiar with Apophenia?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Although I am in support of vaccines, this is a logical fallacy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I always say no to vaccines and they know not to press the issue.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Trump is literally Anti-Vax. Sanders is just pro-labeling. 

Trump is much more dangerous.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
[Not to mention the Anti-Vaxxers are always flat out lying when they claim that.]
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And this is exactly the reason I detest the anti-GM movement.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
While I agree that these things play part it should not an exscuse for violence! That is a conscience decission !

Not anti medicine but opposes vaccines. That's not even a thing that makes sense.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because some people are allergic to some things and there is no connection to vaccines.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"because there is no logical response they can give" - Except neither politicians nor anti-GMOers care about logical responses.

That last comment appears to be either intentional or unintentional twitting of the anti-vax fools.

Have you ever challenged him to a debate?  If not, I think you should...

I've changed to call the anti-vax movement the pro-disease movement...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That explains my 146 IQ .. And my hearing problems.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I read that anti vaxxers are now to be called pro diseasers, is this true?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Conversation goes like this:

Are you allergic?

No.

Is it for religious reasons?

No.

Then why aren't you taking it?

Because I'm not a mindless zombie.

your statement makes me want to play anti vax bingo

No problem.  Anti-vaxxers are used to being at odds with reality.....  :-(
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't even want to know what was said in response...

What a breakhtrough, apparently inflammation of the brain causes broken vertebrae.

Our pushy pro Vax doctor..... Why would an anti vaxxer keep going to a pro Vax doctor?

It doesnt end well. The last Babylon will be like the first Babylon. Embracing an attitude that says ,  " we will be as G-d ." They won't be cognizant of their ' confusion' , just as the very first Babylon wasn't.

That's because atheists and pro-vaxers have one thing in common: They're able to think for themselves.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Its just the same things over and over. If you are interested in hearing the pro vax stance they have many pages to visit.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well it's clear what we need to do. Ban all agriculture!!!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Clearly it is not the vaccines, it's the vitamin C 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because we are not so selfish and egocentric as the vax denier community.

167 people agree with what he said. I find that even scarier.

I hope they become voices against the anti-vax movement now

Informed consent is clearly a defunct concept to employers.  I do think it's not to lawyers though. Read your employment contract, and use the 'security of the person' clause in the Bill of Rights.

Heck no, I'd have to give him an N warning letter for poor behaviour. Even to the point of N determination.

You know why its hard to get them approved? Because NO religion on earth bans vaccination. No religion has any official on-the-book rules against vaccination.

why is no one working the Nuremburg human rights acord from WW2 where it is a violation of international law to force people to accept injections?

So the government wants to restrict the way I practice my religion?

The government cannot eliminate your religious right to exemptions because they're not the government's to take away. It's that simple.

��� What happened to the U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights, Freedom of Religion, and ESPECIALLY the separation of church and state? 

��� How do these legislative bodies have the gall to try to enact a law that judges whether my religious beliefs are valid or not? 

��� Who is going to validate my belief? 
With all due respect, my religious belief is between me and God, not me and some flunky bureaucrat. I answer to God, not to you.

��� The fact is: According to the U.S. Constitution, the government has no right to question my religious beliefs. The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment guarantees me the right to worship as I choose and the government can't penalize me because of my religious beliefs.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't see why there is a distinction between religious and philosophical exemptions anyway.  Either way its a belief you are voluntarily choosing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

We need Medical Freedom in the Constitution, need to put an end to forced vaccination.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But folk who don't need welfare will be able to refuse vax still.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If only we could get a law like this passed in the US.

One of the key ways crime and deviance is represented in the media is fiction.  Sociologists have suggested that the crime in fiction gives society an unrealistic view of crime.

Diane, do you want to force this by law?  What is the penalty for not?  How do we implement it.  We live in a country where personal freedom is a huge value and that will nevet stand.

"In America, martial law must be initiated by the President, who would  then suspends most, if not all, of our constitutional rights. Only the  President has the power to reinstitute our constitutional structure and  declare an end to martial law." Neither the Constitution nor it's agent, the President, can suspend Rights it never gave. The Constitution gives limited enumerated powers from the people to the Federal Government. The President can only suspend those powers or rights that the Federal Government issued. All of our Individual Rights come from Nature, not Government so in essence he will have suspended nothing. We the people however can nullify any and all actions by the Federal Government. PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THIS. We are NOT slaves. The Government was constituted to serve the people, not the other way around.

What can be more important to freedom than your personal beliefs which guide ALL our actions? Our beliefs are formed from many sources, the most important for most is their religion.  They cannot be separated in a case like this.

Isn't forced vaccination an act of war against the American People?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Are they against mandatory vaccination or are they against vaccination, there's a difference.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is why we shouldn't tell everyone they are special
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would say go f your yourself and bring a law suit. Class action.  Get it

Well, regardless this guy is a supporter of taking away informed consent and mandatory vaccinations. GO TRUMP!

this is why i do not support Dr. Carson. Otherwise, I would support him.

They're right though, our comfort is not their responsibility, no it's ours. and part of what makes me comfortable is knowing i have a right to refuse anti-vaxers from entering my home etc.

My daughter is being mandated for vaccinations despite my religious and philosophical rights to exemption in my state. I fought it in court but the judge decided it was a matter if best interest when the pro-vaccine pediatrician testified. Our rights are just an illusion, the government has already taken them from us.

You know you're argument is legit when you have to hide it from everyone but people on social media who already share your opinion.
