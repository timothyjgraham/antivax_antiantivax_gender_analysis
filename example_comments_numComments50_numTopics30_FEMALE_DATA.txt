I'd trust the mechanic over her in regards to health care
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Keep telling yourself that, Beth. Whatever makes you able to sleep at night.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not seeing what her problem is.  She refuses to vaccinate her child and the doctor's office documented it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Refuse to go to work then and see how long the hospitals can run without staff. The patients suffer.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She should be removed from office and given all the vaccines
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why why why why WHY do they even bother going to the hospital when they aren't going to listen to them anyway?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My health care provider wanted me to sign their AAP form.....I was a step ahead and already had my own filled out and ready to give to them. She looked at it, and said, "We have this form as well".  Soooooo... why wasn't THAT form the first option to sign?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He obviously never went to the doctor with his children
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did he get all the recommended vaccines himself? I doubt it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As a nurse I want to tell you, NEVER let a doctor intimidate you. The doctor is YOUR employee and there are plenty of other doctors out there. Dump any doctor you dont agree with.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I seen they are also offering options for naturopathic doctors to their medical insurance plans!! I may have to consider a move for my children's sake!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't think a doctor should bully someone into something.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
i think she should definitely find a new profession. could you imagine having someone like that around telling you to not vaccinate when your at your most vulnerable
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm so glad all of you strangers over the Internet know what's better for my baby than the medical professionals who have been treating him!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I  don't  have  a  medical  degree  but  I  have  a  family  doctor  that  I  trust  and whose  advice  I take unlike  anti vaxxers  who  think they  know  more  than  doctors  do.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I seriously never want to go to a doctors office or hospital where the nurses aren't vaccinated and up to date on their vaccinations. That shit should be mandatory in that kind of workplace
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I refused a flu vaccine with HCA with an agreement to wear a mask in patient care areas and had Titer testing to prove other immunity for things when I was hired.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I say this all of the time: they don't trust "Big Pharma", but they trust what their inserts say.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wait a minute, don't they have to treat you. From what I understand they cannot refuse anyone treatment.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Since when do ER doctors have medical records on hand?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Really? Because I had more than one doctor recommend this vaccine to me. Don't know what kind of doctors you go to...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can I refuse treatment to smokers? They aren't listening when I tell them it's dangerous.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because it is so much better to get your medical advice from a stranger online rather than go to a medical doctor.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They should get their medical advice from Oregon Trail instead.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Notice the child not wearing a mask. Further proof they don't really care about kids as much as they care about themselves.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So... is it like an option? Avoid vaccines OR iDrugs? Given that I don't know what an iDrug is, I opt to avoid that one. Give me the vaccines :D
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wonder if you should contact the police because they are being quite threatening? Especially Ronald.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That damn "staff" infection. They have suggested "get help NOW" from whom I wonder? Surely not a medical professional
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Come out and ask them directly if their kids are vaccinated.   If not refuse the play date.  Especially if you have a newborn in the house
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Do I even want to know what DE and MSM are?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think of kids like Yale all the time. Momma, you are awesome!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's about time a health care provider refused and won!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was let go by our pediatrician because we refused to vaccinate our son.  When I called around to locate a new pediatrician I was told by two different offices that they would not see us if we refused to vaccinate.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I took this course last year. Can't recommend it enough.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't med STUDENTS see patients in their second year? Following the guidance of their teachers? I remember teaching fourth year med students how to do a proper BSL because they don't actually get to work on patients until that far into their medical degree.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
annnnnd I don't want them to be a nurse at all!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My dad is currently being treated at the Burzynski clinic in Houston!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Are you allowed to keep your tin foil hat on at the dentist?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wonder how this would look if per-capita were taken into consideration. Do you know if it was?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The MBBS is a medical doctorate degree in the UK, India, etc...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wouldn't give up my bread unless I had a medical reason to.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But an antivaxxers told me that doctors and nurses know nothing about vaccines...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't listen to everything your told. Irony, she listened to what she was told about homeopathy. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was never bullied in the work place (Healthcare at that) and am very thankful for it! I signed my waiver and took my box of masks and never heard another word. I know so many are not that fortunate!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Even people with medical degrees cannot diagnose someone with ASD by watching them at Costco.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A homeopathic doctor? So you diluted essence of doctors tears down to nothing and ask it advice on your child's health?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
unthinkable that a healthcare worker would NOT be up to date! negligence on his/her part AND the employer!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Of course they don't care because they only care about themselves!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did the medical staff say it was unsafe or did the front office staff say it's unsafe?  Unless the doctor said it then I wouldn't worry about the safety.  You should talk to the doctor tho to be sure his opinion.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
someone needs to buy him a roll of tin foil

Ahahahahahaha! What in the world? Are they serious!?
What were the comments??
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
we know radiation causes cancer, why would we think using radiation was a good thing?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Me as a fully-vaccinated child; all happy, cheeky and full of life. Sparkle sparkle, b*tches.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My breast cancer was found through a mammogram. So thankful I had the mammogram & my cancer was found early.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
We are incredibly lucky to have this technology - to say that early detection methods don't reduce breast cancer deaths is negligent.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So true vaccines can olso cause cancer to children too
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This will be the TSA 20 years from now. ....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How can she have a vaccine-free diabetic kid? Vaccines are what cause diabetes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have had several mammograms and not one of them was painful....you have to have someone that knows what they are doing.  BTW, I ALSO have many friends who have survived breast cancer due to a mammogram that detected it early enough to do something.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think all of that illness early in her life *may* have caused permanent damage to her cerebrum.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
i heard that they can completely cure cancers with icell which is intellegent blood cells made from t cells.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If they can create it surely they must know the cure then
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you had pot, you wouldn't even have diabetes in the first place </s>.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The HPV vaccine is linked to cervical cancer which really does cause harm...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Think of all the people who  were falsely diagnosed with cancer and then permanently damaged by the "treatments." Happens ALL the time!!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've read that immortalized cancer cells called 'He-La', from Henriette Lacks, who died of cervical cancer, are already used.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And how about those Simian 40 cancer causing viruses!  Yeah, give me some of them!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You would think breast milk cured cancer or something with how much they tout it
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Now if only they could do something similar to cure type 1 diabetes!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Makes absolute sense that men who have sex with men get the vaccine that supposedly prevents cervical cancer in women. NOT!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Le sigh. She has more than two children too. Future generations of idiocy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And other vaccines contain polysorbate 80, known to cause infertility
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
so many people say they cured their child's asperburs after "being damaged"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Cannabis cure Cancer!! Google it! The best website is Cureyourowncancer.org.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It was also proven that the polio vaccine caused cancer in the recipients...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
good to know my brain is made of fat, not neural cells.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm going to read a dictionary. It's too early. My brain cannot cope.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wonder if he knows Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are completely different.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If the body can heal itself, why do we need chiropractors?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Cancer cells in vaccines. Leukemia is "just blood cancer." It's too early. I can't.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And no, Cervarix has not been "proven" to cause endometriosis, ovarian cycs, and cervical cancer.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It doesn't cure it, there isn't a cure! We don't even know what causes it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think I lost a brain cell reading that. Must be a vaccine injury. O.0
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Great news. Also, scientists in Cuba have developed a lung cancer vaccine.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
From what I understand, so his body doesn't reject the heart.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
HPV has been known to cause certain cancers in neck for men. 

I seriously doubt they shot him in the neck though. Not much muscle there.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
������ ������ ������ ������ I can't even. It's too early.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's almost as if they want to harm a generation of children.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
All he posts is rubbish about how damaging vaccines are.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Again with this?

Take some lessons in oncology and then propose a cure for "cancer." Actually, first define it. Because you can't. It's not just one disease.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
refuse it........they can't guarantee it is effective against the one HPV that leads to cervical cancer
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The same immune system that will identify a foreign body (vaccine) and build antibodies against it, will build antibodies against a transplanted heart ( also a foreign body).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't know any kids with cancer so that means kids don't get cancer?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My D.O. doctor told me a mammogram gamma radiation is known to cause cancer, especially radiating a woman's breast every year....so he always told me to get a Thermography or do self exams.......in my 70 years I have only had two mammograms and one Thermogram and so far no breast cancer....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is also the man that claimed cervical cancer was the leading cancer in women to push for Gardasil when in fact it's not even within the top three....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No she/he isn't Char. S/he's saying vaccines alter dna and that the damaged dna is passed down.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think... I think that just killed some of my brain cells...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I cured my breast cancer using natural methods. No chemo surgery or radiation for me!...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Kristi- the HPV vaccine protects against human papilloma virus (genital warts) one of the leading causes of cervical cancer.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
With all these "cures" for cancer why is there still cancer?
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 3, '______________________________\n')
I agree. Definitely a test not needed.  It's a money maker....������������
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, at least it's coming out but there will always be a cover up.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wonder how much money the AIFA received to deem the vaccine safe????
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yep- he is on the board of a vaccine company- bought and paid for!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Drug pushers by any other name are still drug pushers
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
but I thought they think measles is no big deal? then why the conspiracy... no big deal right?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I am a American and I have yet to receive my toaster
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So companies selling alternative medicine supplements, etc. don't want to make money?  What's their incentive then to manufacture and sell their products?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No wonder there are far more children with health defects then ever ie Allergies, Autism, Cancer etc etc all to make big bucks for big pharma at the expense of your children! Criminal!!!!!!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yet another way Pharma and their ties can ensure more money in their pockets.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
^except they cost money. Who should pay for them then?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Love of money is the root (foundation) of all evil.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Everybody know you don't get HIV/AIDS from vaccines, you get it from gluten.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
where is Big Pharma, anyway....I just want meds if I get sick
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Money for the doctor and money for big pharma ~ "well visits"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No one should ever be shamed!!  What kind of people do that and sunscreen is another scam we all bought into.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Stories like these are why people are so confused about health. It's not that hard! Consult the dietary guidelines !!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My medical plans have always covered my vaccines 100%. The one time I paid out of pocket it was $20-$30. So big pharma making big money
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe they should worry about the jobs and drug problem instead !
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They should sue for 500million . The pharmaceutical company make a lot of money n of course no amount of money can bring that precious child back.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just remember it's the drug companies who manufacture and sell the vaccines that collate the figures we so readily accept.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why can't we SUE the FDA and CDC, for passing the drugs.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Vaccines are created by the same company as prescription drugs?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The one good thing about Trump. He cannot be bought by big pharma.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Of course!  Their marketing agents work full time -- $$$$$
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It'll never be put to rest, they'll still think it's paid for out of our collective shill fund
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Are there people out there protesting Balto for being a Big pHARMa Shill?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How is Big Pharma supposed to make money off us when they kill us all?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I could REALLY use my big pharma money right now.... Where is it? Why haven't I been paid yet?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Big pharma must have paid all of them off ;)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Its all been marketing since day one,, they are selling their vaccines however they can,, its called desperation!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
God, i want to be a Big Pharm Shill SO BAD.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was also promised a coffee machine. Being a shill for Big Pharma is hard work, you know!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She is in bed with Big Pharma and Big Agribusiness/ Monsanto.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Monsanto is thick in out government.  Seems like the politicians have for the most part sold their souls for big pharma, Monsanto, etc. all who are about depopulation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Get people more sick
Have more patients
Prescribe more drugs
Make more money
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Fluoride is a waste product of Aluminum......guess who sells their waste product to our Gov't to put in our water....It's a poison.....banned in Europe ...bad stuff!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They're sneaking vaccines into the popcorn, that's why its so expensive
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Her spelling is "horriable". And just how many people ���was��� her grandmother?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was thinking that couldnt you have the signs made and sell them i would buy one
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
FDA is owned by big Pharma, guess maybe their shrinking profits are showing how effective natural products are?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They all get bonuses for pushing vaccines more pushed more money. So at the end of the day it's all about money. Not health.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The CDC is owned by big pharma. We know better. Happy to pass along.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And this is how they get the money to spend it in the stores...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So many big words for such a stupid seeming program
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
IF i could like this a million times I would!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's funny how vaccination supports big pharma yet they're willing to give it out for free to those who don't consent........ ������
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Another Monsanto product.  Roundup is banned in Europe, Canada and other countries.  Be careful if you have pets.

What a cost! You can never have your child back as they were.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
$1.2 BILLION in advertising dollars is just too much to give up, apparently.

This is a very interesting article. I hope they find out the exact reason this is happening.

I'm a bit crunchy and my child is getting all of the vaccines.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You just cant help people like this, they are beyond help..
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dr Stoller thank you for your honesty and stay safe
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thank you for speaking out! We should be able to decide whether we want a vaccine or not.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I never liked Jim Carrey in films as an actor, now I like him even less as a person.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thank you, thank you, thank you!  I am watching the entire lecture.

Why so many in the first precious years of life? :-(

God help us all and I'm not even sure there is a god but someone help us!!

Congratulations!   You definitely deserve this--standing up for the truth even though it goes against the grain and met with so much opposition.   May God protect you and bless you each and every day.

good, get that kid some actual help, hopefully mom will listen

I love VfV! This is a great article, and she makes a very, very important point.

So heartbreaking that this could happen to anyone! So very sad! :(
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This breaks my heart. Those poor children have no idea.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Breaks my heart. :( Thank you for your boldness in a time where speaking out is desperately needed.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What?  Do you want to kill me?  I thought you loved me!!

Thank you for your beautiful sharing.  I'm so sorry for your loss.

So well written. Thank you for this article. I will do this and will pass it on. Best wishes to this family.

Terrible!! ������ my condolences to the family who lost a beautiful child. ������
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I only use them when I know I am going to get into an accident. :P
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They have always shed & always will, that's the whole idea.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The withdrawals took a loved one from me.  I HATE xanax.  Thanks for bringing awareness to this.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
These vaccines cannot be any good for our children.  We didn't have to take so many when I was a kid.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Love your comment, just wish the don't vaccinate would listen.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
������������ for you baby girl!!������ Praying both of you stay strong!

Ha ha ha ha good one, had me going for a nanosecond
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm so happy my husband is totally against vaccines just as much as me ������
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No thanks don't get vaccinated wonderful spread of disease.  Good idea.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love this informative video! I'm sharing on my page, and the haters can hate all they want. We WILL get the truth out there.
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 5, '______________________________\n')
This article has no details. This is completely sketchy looking. I can't share this crap because it looks fake. I would look a fool chasing conspiracy theories if I tried to use an article like this to prove any of my points. What a let down. 

As a community we need to be vigilant in sharing fact based verifiable information. How else are we to be taken seriously?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How about hypothyroidism? They say it's linked to that too!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I saw this derper in a pro-info group. Doesn't seem very bright, her post was deleted too.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"I thought I saw something once" is the new "thoroughly tested and scientifically proven fact".
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Love this! I remember having this same conversation with my hubby when we were expecting our first child.. We went on vacation and brought books upon books, and we both read and read and read.. When it was all said and done, we were 100% on the same page! I'm
so thankful that he was open minded and wanted to find out answers on his own:)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is it a group or a page? Just wondering because if they are so proud of what they are doing why are they ashamed to hide it in a group and not on a page for all to see??
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The headlines were screaming 'anti-vax mother' but in reality she was 'pro-vax'.. she just didn't want the WC vax during pregnancy. This is how the media is manipulating the vaccine debate with shoddy journalism and misleading inaccurate information.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Vaccinate your kids!! This article is false.  Just bc it's on the internet doesn't make it true!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's so nice to see some pro vax posts. There is so much anti stuff out there.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Factual information" in the form of blogs which don't cite research, or cite research they don't understand, and youtube quacks.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"I read this thing, so now I believe this thing..."
(I'm guessing that last part is to do with that whole Thompson thing again, yet didn't his study debunk Wakefield -again- as well?)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I read something fabulous on another pro-vax forum , I am on
" Truly researching does not mean stopping at the article that agrees with you "
Just throwing that in
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They're not even posting our stuff, just whining. I'm disappointed in them.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I doubt the teacher said that, but it isn't completely out of the question. The site Not Always Learning has some horror stories about bad teachers, and I could tell a few too. The fact that it comes from an anti-vaxxer casts doubt on the whole incident.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The only thing they DON'T say is a vaccine injury is being pro-vax. I wonder why.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Doug has been presented with a dozen plus peer reviewed papers. He has presented a single 'howstuffworks' article that did not support his claim.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is a lot of homebirth bickering for a vaccinations page.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My dogs say that the third commenter's dogs are reading the wrong studies. The studies they have read say vaccinate your pets and kids idiots.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well she put up a Wakefield article, because we all know this is solid scientific research.  I don't really know what to call this level of ignorance and stupidity!  Her pro vax friend must have tons of patience because I couldn't be friends with her lol
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I tried to like this comment on there but it was removed already.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If they have really "done their research", wouldn't they already have all the links??
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
posted on their fb page...  will try to call tomorrow...  sharing this..
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
MOST of these "Anti-Vax" people were in fact vaccinated as infants. Do they NOT see the irony here?!?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, they didn't NEED a study to know this info, but that's just how REAL scientists do it.... Real science :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The anti-vaxers whose children have celiac will get the vaccine and then pretend like they didn't.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Really good article. Also on same site a brilliant letter 'Dear Pro Vaxxers ....' which is really worth reading.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I hate arriving after comments have been removed - I see all these comebacks, and have no idea what they're referring to.

"Helpful replies only please"

I would never advise anyone to get the Gardasil vaccine but Snopes is refuting your claim and it makes me so angry! The article pops up on my FB page newsfeed when I click on your article.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Time to tell this anti-vaxxer that illegal drugs are far more dangerous than vaccines.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is there a link somewhere to the actual article? I'd love to read it first hand
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It took so long to get to the actual article to read the information, something needs to be done about all the ads laced between each headline and sentence.  I can't even read articles anymore online with so many distracting ads that interfere.    I read a few lines and gave up and when I had to toggle down and over even further.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In the comments of the original post there is a really good refutation that she refuses to adress. Funny....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Does anyone have a link to the recent published research he is citing in the video? I'd  love to see that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
TAVS- do you know what the six comments were? I am afraid for this child.

What does smoking bongs have to do with anti vax?  Everyone I know who smokes is pro vax

I'm tired of the political scare tactics on this page. Can we stick to facts please????!!!!!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I honestly wish I had the time to message these screenshots to every family member these ppl have on FB or post them all on their local papers' websites.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Awesome blog article.  It's so good to read some common sense.  :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yellow's comment would be good if it was a pro-vax one
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't often do medical research but when I do YouTube is my number one source!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you want credibility you don't use Google for research dumbass. But peer reviewed journals must all be bullshit and big pharma bullshit.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Subway is just deleting comments anyways. Hard to be part of any conversation when stuff is getting deleted.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think this person is pro vax and trying to speak the language of avers.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If he makes anti-vaxx posts on a pro-vaxx group, maybe it's the administrator who is deleting them. I know that I would.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
We all know that the anti-vaxxers have "done their research" and will not be convinced by *science*, why should doctors waste their time?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
if there was a little picture that I could post of me making a raspberry at this guy I would.

Steve Walters, apparently this site is only for those pro-vaccination! Anybody intelligently questioning anything at all is apparently not welcome.

Ok ok ok. I dont get the last part. :its ok to sacrifice x amount of kids for the benifit of the majority" is she saying that or is that what her husband said? Because if it's him saying it, and shes all "no that's wrong" then she's a hippocritical bitch.

Quitexapine (or something that sounds like it) made my son completely psychotic. They are so god damn evil, if they aren't vaccine dameged check them for Pyroluria ok

It sounds like a really bad remake of Logan's Run.

No shit. You don't say. It's a good thing I realized this and didn't poison my child.

How would they know? They'd be looking into it if it was their own kid.

then give us clean vaccines! don't put poison into my children!!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My tap water contains fluoride, chlorine, and radium to name a few and I'm always getting letters about how they put too many chemicals in the water. Fiji is literally the only alternate water I've found so far that I can drink without wanting to vomit. I used to get water from a nearby spring but it, like most in my area, have been contaminated by well sites and the pipeline. So it's a lose, lose for me no matter what.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have never EVER bought bottled water; have known from the get go it was a scam...I just use a water filter.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't like injecting moderfied stuff inside of my body either.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Now, if Oregon removes fluoride from their water supply, I just might move there!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There is no way I would let them inject that crap into my child!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would like to know why it is probematic to use aluminum cookware, due to the toxicity of even a small amount of aluminum that might be introduced into the human body by its use, but it is not problematic to use aluminum in certain vaccines, injected into the bodies of infants?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
1 microgram=1 particle of baking soda so 25mcg=25 particles of baking soda
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I recommend getting ZeroWater water filters, they simply are the best. The water tastes clean, and you can test to see if there are impurities in it or now. It turns nasty tap water into just water.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hurry! Get the vitamins out of his body! All of them!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just read whole story. Yes, "all they did" was remove the lead, clean it properly, and treat pain. Oh, and assuring he doesn't instead die from lock-jaw you mooning donkey.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That stuff is full of chemicals!!! I will let my body do what it is naturally supposed to and let me die at age 20!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lmao

The dose makes the poison! I wouldn't inject a 1000 doses of a vaccine in a short period of time any more than I would drink a 1000 glasses of water in a short period of time. And I actually suspect the water would kill me first.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You should NEVER inject Aluminum into your body! It toxic!  Even in small amounts! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Let's start pumping him with all the toxins shots first.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I tested a bottle of their water for purification using my Zero tester. I got a 6 which is still better than over 250 found in our local water straight from the tap.

"Only difference is your kids have all kinds of chemicals...in them and mine don't." If your kids didn't have chemicals in them they wouldn't exist because your kids are MADE of chemicals. -_-
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well its the only water some of us can drink. Water in my area is fluoridated so I can't use tap.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Who do I have to forcibly vaccinate to get on the list?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You drink as much as your body tells you to drink, simple.

You forgot Dr jack wolfson on the list of wackos
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I heard you like toxins so i put toxins in your toxins
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
thanks a lot - I was trying to drink a cup of coffee and now I'm mopping up
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
These people put more and more tinfoil on each day..... wow
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is why our baking bun will never have the Vitamin K. Or any other nuero toxic.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I use it in the bathroom more than the kitchen.  I use it on my face and mix a little with baking soda to brush my teeth.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They should add ACV instead. We all would be so much healthier.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I used to believe that. Then I tried drinking half my body weight in ounces of water a day and it did pretty amazing things for my body, including weight loss, better sleep, better skin and much more.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She can have that. I get snuggles daily without vaccines.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lou Nunzio Loizides, as a Board-certified toxicologist I can assure you that your definition of a toxin is incorrect. A toxin is a poison synthesized by a living organism.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What we are forgetting what antivaxers say, eating and injecting vaccines are 2 different things. 1 goes into our blood stream and to the brain, while the other just goes into our stomaches.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is EXACTLY why I take 100 Tylenol every time I have a headache.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is awful!! And they want us to inject our babies with these toxic chemicals!!!! NO WAY!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I let Lou know that she might have mercury poisoning.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
thats what purified drinking water is.. tap water!! I never buy this junk.. only spring water with no additives
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
At least it isn't made from bone broth and liver I guess. :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because you can buy stuff that requires hazmat to clean up at the corner store.

These people could always just... you know... not drink Starbucks.

wonder what they're hiding that they don't want found in the blood...

Paul Offit is awesome. He is like the Lennon and McCartney of vaccines.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Most folks don't drink enough water.  Water flushes everything.  Water makes blood causing arteries to expand, so pressure goes down.  Water reduces inflammation.  Drink lots of  water.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If I'm bi, did I only get a half dose?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
We can lead the horses to water but we can't make them drink

We should go back to the good old days, before polio vaccins remember, when they all got paralysis or were cripple for life, yes, no polio vaccin, no vaccins.

I didn't like him much before but I like him even less now.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I got chicken pox as a kid, just got it, not from parties.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wasn't vaccinated for the chickenpox and got it from my friend. So u can get it either way. I still have scars from those horrible. Chickenpox.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My mom has my aunt picking some up for Nali.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Since people sometimes get shingles before 50, would it not work if we (the people who had chickenpox before the vaccine was available) got the shingles vaccine sooner rather than later?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't know this gentleman but I wish I did.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'D LIKE ASK HIM IF HE EVER HAD POLIO. I DID. THERE WAS NO VACCINE THEN YOU ARE A FOOLISH  CHANCE TAKER AND YOUR KIDS WOULD BE THE ONES TO SUFFER.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well what a conundrum if they caught chicken pox naturally ������
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I had this when young before vaccines for it existed and I've scars from it :(
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wish the shingles vaccine was given earlier and to care providers, my daughter caught chicken pox from someone with shingles!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When I eas Your age everyone had the measles or mimps but no one I knew in Vienna had bad complications ... True has been hard times for me, my brother and mom, but.....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Looks like the chemo kept him alive for 7 years so far!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
sorry but my wild caught chicken pox at age 4 left behind a nice dose of shingles for me. I would take 1000's of vaccines over shingles again and I hate needles. My kids are braver than me.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I know you're likely right, of course. But it's SO bad. Just...awful.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I got the smallish pox vaccine, but I didn't get the Gay. I want my money back, Big Pharma!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And yet someone my age can't get shingles vaccine. Not fair.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Its horrible all the vaccines they give children today! We never had this when I grew up in the 50's and 60's. I had it all! Measles, mumps, german measles and chicken pox.. Kids never had problems with autism either back then.. Way too much for children today..
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I didn't make it on the list,but at least several of my friends did. Guess I need to be a bigger pain in the ass!!!������
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
OMG! Isn't that what Laura Ingalls Wilder's older sister went *blind* from?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because when you get chicken pox you can get shingles later in life? Read, sweetie.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My brother got arthritis when he was in his 20s and so did my mom. I always thought it was genetics. Silly me.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, by that logic, my mom had 10 kids, we are all vaccinated, and we are all fine.  Guess my mom knows better than miss mom of 3.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You do realize that you can get shingles from the cp vaccine also I hope? Otherwise it looks like you are the uneducated one. The varicella vaccine has also made shingles more common in the young and they knew it would when the studies were done.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My parents took me to play with a cousin that had chicken pox. I asked them, "isn't she contagious still?" They told me no. Lo and behold I had chicken pox not long after that. Missed some school, ate tons of popsicles, used a bunch of calamine lotion, didn't die. I then passed them onto my older brother...who also didn't die, but instead ate popsicles and used calamine lotion. This happened in the early 1990s.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm going in for shingles vaccination, I got shingles earlier in the year and would like to prevent it from being as bad as it was if I do get a flare-up. I wouldn't wish that on any person not even my worst enemy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was vaccinated as a child and i had both the Measles and Mumps
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As someone who had shingles some years back I would not wish that on my worst enemy, If the vaccine had been available years ago I would have had it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Before i resesrched vaccines i had my daughter vaccinated for chicken pox not only did she get then later that year she had them severe and now at the age of 17 she has already had shingles twice ...): now tell me thats not from the vaccines ugh i wish i knew then what i know now
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I remember the measles. I also had the German measles. And I'm still alive !
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So the antivaxxers would rather their children get chickenpox and then get shingles when they are older?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thankfully you ignorant people weren't around when we were getting vaccinated against smallpox and polio.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I did not hear he passed.  Do you know from what at 68 years young?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
People who previously had chicken pox (as a child or as an adult) are the ones at risk of getting one OR MORE attacks of shingles as an adult.

Varicella vaccine wasn't available when I was a kid, but my parents kept me safe from exposure to chicken pox (thank you Mum & Dad).  I got chicken pox as an adult in the 1980s and that is why I had the shingles vaccine last year.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Chicken Pox too. Now they tell us that chicken pox then will give us shingles now?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Damn I never got measles.  I could have super powers by now
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My youngest got it twice after being vaccinated for it both times
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
i didn't think they had a chicken pox vaccine back in '88...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Today my kids cried because I wouldn't let her run with scissors. What a horrible mom I must be.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, my kids got measles from a vaccinated child! ������
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They are going to screw things up entirely before they are done I think.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sure are I had them twice but no more got the vaccine .
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If I were your inlaws dumbass I wouldn't have you in my house.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I once had a terrible migraine and only had an aspirin that had expired 6 yrs. earlier - still worked.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm vaccinated and I have had mumps before but the vaccine made it not as bad it could of been much worse
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When I was younger, my whole neighborhood was vacinated. We somehow all came down with the chicken pox anyway. All the mothers in our neighborhood knew and let all the kids play together just to get it over with. It wasn't even a big deal
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There is a vaccine for chicken pox. People who get chicken pox are at risk of the virus manifesting later in life a shingles - which sucks ass way worse than chicken pox.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
nah, the shingles vaccine will still be needed because of people like me lucky enough to get chicken pox from the vaccine
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Probably the child's DNA has vaccine memory from when grandma Edith got the Polio Vaccine.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Are you serious? Please read a science book that explains how vaccines work

If I found this in a book, I'd be reporting it so that other books can be checked for this garbage.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So sorry for your loss, I pray you find strength to continue educating people about vaccines.

Please tell me they're in Australia & can be identified so I can report them to AHPRA

Dr. Tenpenny you are needed on Fox News. Megyn Kelly appears to have been bought out by Big Pharma.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
^and how do you know it was correlated? Name of the people and case in VAERS as well as autopsy report please.

Please be careful Dr. Tenpenny on Vaccines & Dr. Bob Sears!

I'm so very sorry to hear, Sherri.  My deepest condolences to you and your family.

Would be the last day my kid was in that school.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
when it becomes mandatory please find me an island far away from those crooks
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I need one of these. My birthday is coming up ������������
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
These kids don't belong in school. Keep them home and home school them!!!!!!!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Being denied Public school entry seems like a win to me!!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I hope the "wack-o" SIL requires proof of vaccination to attend.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Milo or maybe it's the cereal, has 4 or more stars - what the?!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And that's why these days most med schools require some undergraduate research, and most include at least a little epidemiology in their course work.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
At least they will all be together. Maybe they will continue to homeschool.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes, they should not be allowed in school at all.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Australia just made it mandatory too. No exceptions except medical.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Doctors can't 'waltz' into schools and vaccinate kids without parental consent. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
you are my voice of reason.. thank you so much
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Definitely not a place on my "to visit" bucket list!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You are not required to set yourself on fire to keep others warm.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The Ohio State University is requiring students to get vaccinated.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There is already a preschool aka "day care" mandate in place. Although, with a philosophical exemption.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you are not willing to follow the rules put in place to protect the public, you should not be allowed in public spaces. Nut up and homeschool, or vaccinate your kids.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Funeral homes do nothing gladly. They do it out of necessity.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I grew up in Mayfield Hts. Ohio....I miss living there!!!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wish they wouldn't bring they unvaccinated children at school. That's the only fair thing here.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Our state allows religious exemptions.  Parents have to fill out a form that includes this:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have had kids going home with letters that is they aren't vaccinated, they will not be allowed to go to school
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Next vaccine that enters my kids will be the day after the one I die.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is in the department of Health Studies. Some of the students taking this course will presumably go on to make public health policy. There's just so much wrong with this.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
NY will be voting on removing religious exemption in January and I'm sure we will be following what California has done....we'll be home schooling or moving.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
as far as I know not any amount like this in Australia???
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I live in IL my kids are in school under religious exemption.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They will just write some new law to prevent that
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I hope they aren't homeschooling, their children will be morons.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Also you DON'T have to be vaccinated to go to school
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Does anyone know if ohio passed a law for mandatory vaccines  in daycare if it's federally funded?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For the record, your child's vaccination status has everything to do with the health of not only your family, but the public in general.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If vaccines work, why is the unvaccinated child a threat??  Riddle me this....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
you all know of course that there is NO SUCH thing as Federal Programs Preschool..........
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Do you have to live in California for this to count
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she will need one who specializes in international law...the laws in the USA don't apply to the rest of us...just sayin.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They'll just tell her to 
A. Take her kids out of school for a while
B. Continue to send her unvaxxed kids to school with onions.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Then the unvaccinated should be tax exempt too! No public schools then why should we have to pay taxes that cover schools right!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And that's why I moved away from northern NSW to study science.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Even though we have exemptions in Ohio, they are still trying to get middle school and high schools to give these.  I see the shedding as a huge problem.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Now I'm hereee,  I think I'll stay arouuund arouuund arouuund. .. (in your immune system) *hums* \m/
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Get with the program and get on board with this Oregon!!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For those in CA, you will also need to send your children out of state to college.  Starting in the fall of 2016, proof of vaccines will be required for all university students.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wanna go back to the days when schools were passing out condoms!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Let it be known that most people who celebrate halloween do not consider it a pagan holiday, just a fun day to get candy from people for free. Also schools celebrate it: Halloween parties& parades.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I hope CPS are able to take him away from her quick!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
MANDATORY vaccination laws are being proposed state by state ...... Contact your Representatives .....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thought the same thing Dr T! Homeschooling with the help of public school. What a laughingstock!

Wakefield never linked MMR width autism - where do these journalists  get there info ?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So it's vaccines not my genetic defect causing all my issues.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
DeNiro's son is autistic which makes this even more interesting to me.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
lol I used to be a case manager for adults with developmental disabilities. The oldest was maybe late 70s... autistic. Of course it wasn't diagnosed that back in the day, but that's exactly what it is.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Autistics are the first to say vaccines don't cause autism........ because  vaccines don't cause autism.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
ADD is no longer a diagnosis. It's now a subtype of ADHD, according to the DSM-V.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The study that needs to be done is 'How many people that are not vaccinated get cancer later in life?' The FDA does not want us to know this!

Like
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have two sons with autism. This is one of the worst calls to activism I've ever seen. To say that dreams are shattered and childhoods are lost is hate speech to the autistic community.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There are NO long term studies with vaccines, they are all "experimental".
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Autism seizures"...Now they just make up their own medical diagnosis.  They have no idea.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have never had any problem from vaccines and they did not include any mercury or alumin
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why, oh why, is autism spoken about as though it is an horrendous affliction? Newsflash- it isn't! And it's extremely offensive to say that to people who are autistic!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They can cause encephalitis, which can cause autism...so, they found a neat little loophole & used semantics to make us THINK that vaccines aren't linked to autism.  They are.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you consider autism neurodegenerative some cases are then there's a possibility
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not allowing your child to have the speech therapy to correct his "problem" is neglect. Why the fuck wouldn't you want to correct any speech problems to prevent your kid from being made fun of in school, and possibly cause problems later in life as well?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would love if someone could find studies with this also showing no change in % of autism with kids vaccinated and not vaccinated
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So they know how to create them, huh?  Doesn't that imply they know the causes of autism?!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This vaccine injured my legs and causes me to faint on a regular basis!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
God, I hope her kid develops an allergy to something...
I've never been able to find data on this, but maybe we can look our resources: how many unvaxxed children are on the spectrum?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's not an illness or disorder, being neurotypical is no great shakes...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is so good!  Just what I would have expected from Jimmy Kimmel.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Honestly? No, better diagnosing doesn't cover it. Where are these kids today if that is the case? Because even high functioning kids are not likely to be gainfully employed.  At the current diagnostic numbers, these un diagnosed adults should be everywhere. They aren't.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ever notice how they claim we 'fear monger' but they are all DEATH!!!!! AUTISM!!!!  INJURY!!!!!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
One of the main things that differentated Aspergers from autism was no significant delay in speech. There is no way in hell they got that diagnosis for an infant.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't think we can be 100% positive that vaccines don't play some role in the rise of autism
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She has symptoms of vaccine injury too and that's just sad!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Jackie Crowther isn't this the one you mentioned to me?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Autism say the researchers, is caused by Genes and I will add Genes and Johns and Joes���
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
We need to establish why there are so many allergies in today's society
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There are an average of 7 cases of plague each year in the U.S. These people are so ignorant.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have never been personally swayed by celebrities or millionaires I do my own research and determine how to manage my own health and my children.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So, what's the explanation for those who had these conditions prior to the advent of vaccines?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't see how we can even guess as to the number of older adults with autism most were not properly diagnosed do not receive medical care are alone exist alone so how could there possibly be a number assigned as to how many older autistic individuals there are
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Mental illness is one manifestation of physical illness....they are inseparable.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
so what exactly was the cause of death? this is how many now?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And if you get the vaccine you'll never have a headache,Backache or weight problems!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes, they are mocking you (because vaccines don't cause autism!!!)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The vaccines have caused a lot of autism in boys mainly
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I never blamed my son's Dr. For my son's vaccine injury.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not sure what you would like me to explain in that paper Greg? Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDDNOS) are on the autistic spectrum. We still have a long way to go with autism research but thus far it is known that autism happens in utero, well before the child is even born. It's a neurodevelopmental syndrome, not something that is a side effect of a vaccine.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
what amounts for the supposed increase in autism are three factors. First, in the mid-90s, the definition of autism was expanded to include related disorders such as Asperger's Syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. This created the category of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs), which meant that more people who did not fit the classic definition of full-blown severe autism were now included in the diagnostic category. This is called diagnostic expansion. When you expand a diagnostic category, by definition you'll see an increase. However, this doesn't mean that the actual rates increased, it simply means that people with the disorders are now recognized as having them.

The second factor is that as rates of diagnosis of ASDs has increased, rates of diagnosis of mental retardation and other developmental disorders, and of learning disabilities, and of childhood schizophrenia, have gone down. This means that those children are now being more properly diagnosed with ASDs. This is called diagnostic expansion.

The third factor is earlier recognition and intervention, which is associated with a better outcome.

In any event, Evan McCarthy doesn't have autism.

I agree with Lauren. Individuals on the autism spectrum have more severe reactions to most things. Vaccines don't cause autism just exacerbate it greatly. The only proof I have is that I know several families where autism can be traced to pre-vaccine era

Already explained! He REMOVES TURMORS! They study ANYTHING they remove from ANYONE that has something removed during surgery!!!

So how do they explain the children that have autism that have never been vaccinated (I sadly know two)?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can I just ask this?..If autism is caused by vaccines. . Why aren't all people who are vaccinated autistic??..

I want to know their definition if autism. It seems anything post vaccines is autism!

The only problem I see ,with that comment . Is the fact that if a baby has an autoimmunity disorder  you will not know for years! And  what possible effect will they have on their little bodies.

I would rather have a list of pesticides used to grow produce organic pesticides (those used in organic farming) have some not so great research. I don't feel like people have a "right" to label food if it isn't dangerous. Do you not realize this will raise food costs and poor people will have a harder time feeding themselves? I doubt anyone in favor of labeling has looked into that at all why would they? It isn't about them.

I see they said reduced fat yoghurt & dairy? My understanding is that reduced fat is topped up with sugar or sweeteners, so they are better off with full fat aren't they?
Some days, you pick your battles too.  My kids will make themselves a banana, berry, yoghurt & nut smoothie for breakfast, so I'm not going to bust their balls making them eat fruit at school, as they've already had a decent amount of fruit for breakfast.

Furthermore the milk that's offered as a choice isn't any healthier. It's full of hormones, the real nutrients are boiled out of it during the pasteurization process, then it's pumped full of artificial vitamins. No different than so much of the junk prepackaged food we protest already.

To be fair their conventionally grown stone fruits are being recalled along with the organically grown varieties. However, it also just shows that organic produce is no less likely to contain dangerous pathogens than regular. It isn't safer, just more expensive.

All the more reason to grow your own food and find an organic farmer who raises both vegetables, fruit and meat.

Jokes on him - organic unless he's growing them himself, have pesticides.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The process of getting organically certified is probably the reason - along with the fact that organically certified farms are not plentiful.  We have the most organic farms here in California and we supply most of the organic food in the country.  It takes 3 years of testing, replacing soil, etc. to get a farm certified organic.

Yes, but to have healthy things in the kitchen we need to stop government to allow garbage companies to produce our food. It is wild for me to get real organic food from farmers. Government is causing me havoc.

the alternatives have always been there but for some reason people are shunned and looked down upon for seeking them out because your going "against science" yet that science was already there

Do thermal or ultra sound only I will never do mammograms too many rads.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I totally disagree with you on this one. "That's just my intuition at work." What kind of science is that and why are you making claims you can't back up. Speculating isn't healthy either.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I will never do any more mammograms do ultra sound or thermal a lot safer.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because certain knobheads don't vaccinate that's why they're still here
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Vaccines can change DNA now? Well that's a major breakthrough in science.

Alternative medicine shouldn't be called alternative if it works. It should just be called medicine. Hocum.

Well at least she understands what it really is about.

It often bothers me that people don't understand that 'look how healthy people used to be without modern medicine' etc. worked like: it meant that the weak died. Especially children.

They are not going to think of others. They don't even protrct their own children.  Why would non vaccinators even begin to think of others children?!?!?!? SELFISH!

The bubonic plague still exists, and there is no vaccine for that, either. These people just keep getting more ignorant, don't they?

I'm agreeing with this! That way natural selection will take it's course.

I'm not for homeopathy. I guess that makes me a homeophobe.

Why kill us when they're already killing their children & other innocent people? Hilarious.

How dare they use the r word.  Well if they do t vaccinate they must have perfect children. Must be the vaccines

Do they even realise how high child mortality was before antibiotics?

I have 3 unvaccinated kids who are healthy as can be.

I will never harm my child with vaccines but if my child dies a horrible excruciating death that's ok?

I have a 11 year old daughter and I would be livid!!!!

Poor Baby.  Hug the healthy children you have and protect them in any way you can while they are growing up.  As a parent you will never stop worrying about your adult children,but  at least you will know that they physically made it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
All these people are strait up Munchausen by proxy. I genuinely worry for their children.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If children die because of unvaccinated children then the parents should be charged with murder, that simple....I've had whooping cough as an adult, I can understand why babies die, it's a horrible sickness
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Funny.. Getting my son vaccined before I knew better sure did NOT protect him from Whooping Cough.. Not to mention how often he gets sick :(
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess I will tell that to the families of the babies who died of pertussis.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I too worry about my son's ammun system.

(But I wouldn't let that chick's unvaccinated kid around my three week old.)

They're sick. The only thing I care about is protecting my child. She will be vaccinated.

Here's my vaccinated 16 month old. Look at the lack of life in her eyes. *eyeroll*

These are my 8 unvaccinated kids!! All alive,  and extremely healthy! Coincidence... I think not!!

Because my little baby might not be old enough to be vaccinated yet & you are endangering her life!

Yes whooping cough is so mild....it's not like babies die or anything...wait...

the solution is to ban both: nuts AND unvaccinated kids!

Gee, how did life ever survive so many millions of years without vaccines???

They're a threat to the kids that are too sick or are too young to be able to be vaccinated.

How is he doing over all ? Poor baby :-(
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"I don't want THAT near my healthy kids" like a vaccinated child is just a walking disease incubator.

There has to be more to this, right? An 11 year old is old enough to be home alone.

'THE' whooping cough? What's that? So they had pertussis without the cough, perhaps?

I see these posts way too much! Poor babies :(

They are s threat to the innocent who are medically ill and cannot be vaccinated. They are a threat to the children who are not old enough to be vaccinated.

So they become one less to get cancer by dying before that?

I had whooping cough as a healthy 26 year old. I woke up repeatedly unable to breathe. It took all my strength to reopen my airways, which were completely blocked with phlegm.

I don't know how children survive it, but if this child gets it, I hope they survive and the mother...  learns... to... VACCINATE.

Immunity from pertussis may not be lifelong, but the lung damage just keeps on giving!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It seriously makes me sick that people like this blame healthy kids that aren't vaccinated for this yet they are fine. Where is the logic in that!?

Now where is the part where the vaccine kid dies after getting a vaccine
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What about the too young babies who may come into contact with the unvaccinated kids at school, while coming with mums or dad to pick up older siblings.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't think McDonalds know what healthy is, that is why they are backing immunisation.

Someone I know who is not vaccinated, nor is her mother,  one of her children is on the autism spectrum. So AV's tell me how???

I beg to differ. Have you ever seen a baby with whooping cough? People don't die from autism. They die from pertussis.

Only partially vaccinated kids. I was unaware of the scam and corruption early enough, but my kids are never sick and have been healthy 18, 15,16, 12 & 6..

Teaching lay people about vaccines is like trying to teach a first grader algebra.  There's just too much of a knowledge gap to fill in so they can make the connection.  Thing is, I'm starting to realize that they don't want to learn, they simply want to defend their indefensible position.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As long as parents who chose not to immunize their kids are also ready to accept any negative consequences, then by all means go for it. 
Just like parents who chose to protect their kids with vaccines should be prepared to accept any negative consequences. 
'You are free to chose but not free from the consequences.'

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I am also choosing not to vaccinate, it is tough because we have been taught and brainwashed that we are suppose to vaccinate.  I am nervous, but going with my gut and not going to vaccinate!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There goes my belief that Germans are well educated. *sigh*

My mother used to tell me that since she gave birth to me, she has the right to take my life away at any moment she feels is necessary.  I grew up that way and still believe my life is disposable because my parents felt I was an object to be used and not a human to be taught.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Good for you. You know what is right for your children and they are your responsibility so keep doing what you feel is right for them and let go of everyone elses ignorant comments and judgements because their opinions don't define who you are as a person or a mother. Your children are worth this fight!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
so? HER CHOICE. period. end of story. just as its YOUR choice to vaccinate YOUR animals & YOUR children. its also HER choice to NOT vaccinate her animals & her children. until its a law to fully vaccinate animals & humans it will always be HER choice. end of story. get over it.

What happened to our 'right of confidentiality'?  If even our employers have no right to know any of our medical info, why would schools have that right?  If people with HIV are protected from having to inform, why would anyone have to inform about any medical info?  What happened to our 'freedom of choice'?   High praise for the kids being affected by this issue for becoming involved & fighting for their rights...& their own safety!

How is that suppose to be healing...to take your family away in a time when you need them most!!!???
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Two things. One-I'm going to  give you a plate of MSG for all of your meals. Two-if you vaccinate it shouldn't concern you that others don't as you are vaccinated. Stop nannying and protect yourself. I know, there are times when people are vulnerable but precautions can be taken until then (as they were when I was a child). Would you rather take away a persons choice than take precautions? I know i wouldn't. And i'm still pro-vac.

SO many trolls! I don't get how many can be so heartless to a parents child or a parent.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It is tragic when children die for their parent's selfish ideals.  So, everyone who agrees that anti-vaccers have no right to risk their children's lives also agree that abortion is murder, right?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The truth is if they're mind is already made up that they're safe then there is no information that you can put in front of them for them to care. Drs need to give this to patients and say exactly what can happen when these ingredients are administered! That's the only way!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Why should you teach your daughter to respect the health of others? They should only be respectful of your daughter's health." That's literally the hypocrisy they are telling this parent.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How can any antivaxxer say, "We're all entitled to our own opinion, re: vaccination"? They believe vaccines are more harmful than the diseases, but still think it's okay for other people to continue to vaccinate? What do they actually believe?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think it's just saying. Think for yourself and question authority. It's only natural to want to seek our own truths and that's the beauty of freedom and choice. Choose wisely, keep asking questions, keep finding answers. Keep striving for a better way. Science, unless it's geology haha, is never set in stone. It's not meant to be. The answers always ask for more questions. Lets ask questions that provide answers for a safer world. It's human. It's awesome. Peace.

I show people over and over package inserts and they still are in denial. Some are so far gone that even if THEIR child was a victim they will still deny it was the vaccines. Unfortunately not everyone will put the 2 and 2 together :(

Education committee is the next step for this abhorrent bill...So, the CA Senate Health Committee voted in favor of SB277 with 6 votes for, 2 against, and 1 abstention. It's on to Education next week. Here's the problem - we know it's going to pass the Judiciary Committee the week after that because 4 out of 7 already signed the bill, so next week's Education meeting is our last chance to get the bill to die in Committee. In Education, only 2 out of the 8 members co-signed already. Even if it makes it through Committee, it still has to pass the whole Senate. Then after that, it has to pass the CA Assembly. So, it's not over yet....There is still hope CA! If you have not gotten spoken up NOW IS THE TIME!!!! Go to: http://www.yourfamilyyourchoice.org/ for template forms and talking points...

Hearing is April 15th.

California's bill was released yesterday and it doesn't look good!' Blow up your senators and let them know this is a violation of human rights and violates our constitution 

Hi friends! I worked on this all morning! Since we aren't working with a lot of time, I have created this short cut of all the California Senate's personal email and phone contact info. If you submit through the website, they don't allow you a lot of room to write your thoughts on opposing this bill. Lets start flooding all email addresses, then follow up with phone calls. If you have friends that will write for you, have them write as well. Create a uniform letter and copy and paste to all emails. Much love to my fighters!

The California bill just came out and it doesn't look good. All exemptions gone! All that will remain is medical and it is almost impossible to get. It will have strict regulations from strict doctors. Call your senators! Blow them up. Let them know this is a violation of human rights and our constitution!!

Hi friends! I worked on this all morning! Since we aren't working with a lot of time, I have created this short cut of all the California Senate's personal email and phone contact info. If you submit through the website, they don't allow you a lot of room to write your thoughts on opposing this bill. Lets start flooding all email addresses, then follow up with phone calls. If you have friends that will write for you, have them write as well. Create a uniform letter and copy and paste to all emails. Much love to my fighters!

Senator Benjamin Allen

His office told me his mailbox is pretty full. I was given an alternative email for his scheduler. Send email to both.

Apparently vaccines aren't natural because they were artificially (meaning by man) created by ingredients that magically poofed onto earth from unnatural land. But when birds build nests and insects have been farming much longer than us it's "natural" but as soon as a man manipulated something, nope it's not "natural" anymore. Artificial is a subcategory of natural. Living creatures have been manipulating the environment for a lot longer than humans. We just do it at a more complex level. Not everything natural is good for you, and not everything artificial is bad for you. "Natural" or "artificial" is not an argument. Until you ignore these words, and actually look at studies of particular ingredients and what they do to the body, this is just an uneducated assumption known as the naturalistic fallacy. On another note, here is a bunch of links for peer reviewed studies on the safety of vaccines particularly with autism (they conclude no causation what-so-ever):

Blowing holes in her vaccination causes every thing wrong ever.
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 27, '______________________________\n')
Last time I got the flu I got pneumonia within 2 days. It can be bad for some.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Carleigh I just got told today from Royal Brisbane Hospital no way I'm I to have the flu jab - now that says something. I have a eye condition and a flu jab will set it off again.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Gawd, where do they get this crap from? My friends son: born naturally and no vaccines here at birth yet he still has asthma.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Flu shot didn't even give me a sore arm. It was literally just a pinch when the needle came in and that was it, most vaccines have not had side effects on me, really.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My daughter is preemie and had to get a flu vaccine. I hate it cuz she was just fine until after she got the shot and is running a very high temp for 2 days now. It seems like it's not going down God help us all!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I am not an anti vaccination. I have made sure all 60 of my care kids have them.  My bubby has just had a nasty reaction and ended up very sick in hospital after vacs
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Every day we are one day closer to death. That's called "life"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My problem is figuring out where to take my 18 month old for a flu shot because her doctor doesn't offer them in his office anymore.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thought it was gross and way too hard to do for 15 or 20 minutes every day so  hats off to all of you who are "pulling" it off (no pun intended :).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Also, I have now been vaccinated as an adult and my children have received boosters recently.  Which is all new I was told!  For my 12 year old at least!!! So this is a great step in the right direction!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Do women need a Pap smear once a year or every two years?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have never had the flu shot, my husband has never had the flu shot, and neither has my daughter. We rarely ever get sick, we live an organic lifestyle. Wash your hands, eat healthy, sleep well, and exercise. You do that and you don't need a flu shot.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My son rolled over on his own at 3 months, had his first tooth at 4 months, crawled at 6 months and walked at 8 months and he is up to date on every single vaccine so i call bullshit. She obviously knows nothing about child development. I would run far away from that nutjob. What an idiot.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Some women would have just ran and got an abortion.  So glad that she did not.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So true. Vaccines turned my four month old into a Triceratops. When will people learn!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think I am going to take this with me to my family doctor when I bring the kids in for their check-up / annual flu shots.

Maybe it was the flu shot and not the flu

My little one just got her first round MMR today, for herself and to protect the littles who cannot be vaccinated. ���������������
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess I don't have to bother vaccinating my son since I'm fully vaccinated and just in case, I'll just feed him GMOs and have him around vaccinated people since he can catch the vaccines from them!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Two of my husband's employees called in sick today because they had serious reactions to the flu vaccine.  Sigh.  WHY don't people READ and learn?!?   Ack!

I didn't immunize either of my kids when they were born. My daughter didnt have a single immunization until she was 12 and it was mandatory to leave the country. She was ith her dad or I'd of frowned upon it! That shit is evil! I don't trust what they put in those needles. Homeopathic all the way! My daughter, now almost 21 is healthy and vibrant... Same with my 5 year old son.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh theyre so annoying! I finally figured out just tell em I got my shot even though I didnt, ahaha!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When I got my third trimester Flu shot and TDaP, I was not offered a lollipop. I was extremely disappointed, even at age 30.

There's also another one of "Nurses against ALL vaccines" that I told you about. Decided to create some mischeif there, as I told you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just refused it! And the DTAP! I said..."I can't have those, I'm pregnant!!!!"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's awesome! Which reminds me I need my tetanus booster
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I tried getting the pertussis vaccine when I was pregnant a little over two years ago but the OB made me wait until I gave birth.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I lost that right a long time ago.   No shot, no job.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My flu symptoms after a flu shot compared to those years when I didn't have one... make me want a flu shot.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For anecdotal point last year my Dr. gave me the flu shot, whooping cough vaccine and the phenomena vaccine early in the season. My husband got the shot at work. I admit it we were bad and neglectful and forgot to get our daughter the shot.
Our state had a huge outbreak. Thankfully my daughter lived through her bout of the flu without any complications. It was horrible to watch her be so sick and suffer. This year she has been asking for the flu shot since November.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Flu Vax is the only one I don't do... The one year I had it I was the sickest I've ever been... And each time I've had the flu I've got the strain that wasn't covered by the vaccine...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hahaha that's cute. 

I got my flu shot today because I was jonesing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When my mom let me have a fever like that for days I ended up in icu for a week. How is this not abuse?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Scary. I, as an adult, received a tetanus shot when I was bitten by an animal. Immediately after the shot I passed out and had a seizure. As I was coming to, trying to breathe, my vision impaired, I heard the nurses saying, "she's seizing". This went on for a few minutes until I was able to talk and breathe normally. An hour later the doctor came in and said, you didn't have a seizure, you just passed out. Really? I'll never get a tetanus shot for the rest of my life. Plus, how many people do you know that had lockjaw? Coverup.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I got both at about 32 weeks.  I don't think I got them at the same time, though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I also have a friend who saw a change in her son's eyes  the day after vaccination.,she could see a difference in him right away. . He has been diagnosed with autism. Another friends daughter was given drugs when she was an Infant because of an infection and after the drugs where given to her she swears she went home from the hospital with a different child. She has never been the same since.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My 4 month old for her second round today, not including the TDaP while I was pregnant with her. She's not thrilled with me but I'm sure a breathing tube would be worse than the cold shoulder.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I get a flu shot every year and it is super nice not getting sick!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My son was on heavy drugs for his first two weeks of life, he walked at nine months. It must have been the antibiotics and painkillers.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And that was exactly what my pediatrician told me to give to my baby who developed a massive fever after his 15 month MMR shots. Now he is 20 years old and is severely autistic.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I want to ask her if she's actually spent hours and time learning English.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ugh, I had to get my tetanus booster a couple months ago....those are my least favorite. But it kept me from getting tetanus after stepping on a thumbtack!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
An old co-worker died from the flu a couple of weeks ago
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I had a patient inform me yesterday that she has gotten the flu every single year that she has gotten a flu shot. I questioned her on her "flu" symptoms...a stuffy nose and sneezing every year in early September, when she happens to get her flu shot. It also happens to be ragweed season in New York. I think a large number of people claiming to get the flu after being vaccinated are actually getting a cold or seasonal allergies. Since they've never actually had the flu, they don't realize how very sick it makes you, to the point that you want to stay in bed for a week. The flu is a full body, feel like a zombie and don't want to move kind of illness.  Stuffy, runny nose, cough, and sneezing are your only flu symptoms? You probably picked up a cold and should tell the people around you to cover their mouths when they sneeze and start washing your hands more, because the flu vaccine isn't ever going to prevent you from getting a cold. Oh, and stomach viruses don't count as the flu either...better keep washing your hands! =)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I had the flu shot twice.   Each time I was sick for 6mths..  I refuse to get them, and the funny thing is (unless it  is my imaginatio), everyone else who gets the shot gets very sick. I just had a small bout and am basically over it. Build your immune system by eating healthy and stay rested
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A friend was talking, saying she was feeling really sick. She looked sick. She had had her flu shot and was quite happy at the thought of being sick for a few days, because people over seas had died from the flu, and she was only having flu like symptoms and not the flu...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I saw a headstone in my hometown where a family lost 3 children in the space of 2 days and wondered if it had been from some epidemic (this was over 100 years ago).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My mom had a Tetanus Vaccines:  shot after being bite by a dog on the way home her eyes started to roll I was with a friend who a Nero nurse she ask to you have a benadryl one you I did she explain my mom was having a reaction to the shot!Which I  had explain to a doctor filling in for my mom primary doctor that she has reaction to shots before! made complaint with primary he told me he would note it on her record.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not going to try to convince the flu shot pushers why I refuse the flu shot because it's none of their business and also I don't really care what they think or what they say
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 28, '______________________________\n')
Over at MAM, they're going to sue.  Because they won't be silenced, blah blah blah.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
244 people infected - yet the vaccine effective rate is supposed to be 95-100% and later in the article reads "most who contracted said they were vaccinated"... Hm??
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ok while I see your point i needs to be said of developed countries as there are 50+ with higher rates.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think that it���s a matter of efficacy: the measles vaccine is almost entirely effective, whereas the efficacy of the flu shot varies from year to year, never matching the success rate of the measles vaccine.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
First of all, isn't the vaccine "supposed" to prevent disease? Second, it doesn't. Third, there's no proof and never can be. How can you prove someone was going to get something or not? You can't. You can, however, see that the vaccinated get the very diseases they are vaccinated against...Hmm...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
We are finding out that vaccinations wear off (vaccinated adults are getting the measles and mumps).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I must have missed the bit where it even matters if the kid was offered a HIV vaccine, because if it was added to the schedule, it would be because it's safe and effective... oh and because this dimwit isn't vaccinating against anything.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just quickly examined this thing.  Does anyone else find it odd that the immune compromised individuals just obtain "healthy, high immunity" status after having the disease instead of "dead" status?  Immune compromised individuals are at very high risk of serious complications from these illnesses...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Megan: It is possible to get it (both as child and adult), but very rare in the US for non compromised individuals, since the most common source has been almost eliminated via vaccination. There are both other, rarer causes for epiglottitis, which is an inflammation due to bacterial infection of the epiglottis, not specifically an Hib infection, and of course people who aren't vaccinated for Hib can get it from that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And, by the way, pertussis does not confer lasting immunity like many other childhood illnesses. You can get it over and over and over again. vaccinate!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because eczema is an autoimmune disease. When you get a vaccine it takes a hit on your immune system while your body makes antibodies. Better than your child dying of diphtheria or tetanus.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The risks of vaccination are vastly outweighed by the risks of the diseases they protect against. I for one would never want rabies or tetanus. Whooping cough, measles and mumps are awful too. People still die of these diseases today, mainly in developing countries that do not have access to vaccines.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That is because the vaccine makes it more than five times as likely you will get the disease.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why is it that the antivaxx crowd thinks vaccination is a magic bubble and diseases just bounce off it. 
It is not. You can catch the disease if exposed,  all the vaccination does is provide the weapons so your body can recognise the disease and fight it. That's why we are afraid of your little disease vectors because our kids are exposed to your germs and can still spread diseases to babies, old people and immune comprised people.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The warning label, you know the insert that's comes with EVERY vaccine, says that reproduction animal studies have NOT been performed.  They do NOT know what possible harms could come to your child or your reproduction system!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So... they're relying on herd immunity? Maybe they should come to where I live where immunization rates for five year olds have dropped to 65% ������
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Also, all those who recover from measles are at risk for the long term complication of SSPE (sub-acute sclerosing panencephalitis) the rare but always fatal brain inflammation with an onset 7-10 years after measles infection.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Heather Sunshine not all vaccines work on an individual. Sometimes it just doesnt take and your child is still at risk. The idea is that if enough people around that child is protected by a vaccine then it dramatically decreases the chance of them contracting something. But the issue occurs when an infected child comes into contact with your child there is still a chance that they'll become infected also.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The tiny amount of thimerosal in the multi-dose flu vaccine is, however, safe. The larger amounts included in the schedule before 1999 were studied, and found not to be harmful.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It will help people develop "natural" immunity instead of needing vaccines
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A common side effect of all vaccines is contracting the illness it is meant to protect you from..... So..... How is this going to be safe?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
SMDH, compared the number of people who were vaccinated against those who were exposed that we vaccinated. That will give you the 99% efficacy rate. Not the percentage out of the number of cases
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This debate continues to confuse me.  The article does not compare the rates of  the diseases that kids get vaccinated for -- whooping cough, mumps, measles, etc.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She would like to avoid polio.  Tetanus and diphtheria are acceptable, though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It was actually two adults who traveled and contracted the measles.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Shingles are caused mainly by the chicken pox vaccine"?????? Wtf?!?! 

Considering the varicella vaccine has been around for 20 years, and it is GENERALLY people much older than that who develop shingles, I don't see how that even makes sense.

"Everybody knows the leading cause of death 1736 was auto accidents!"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What matters is children need to be vacinated for measles unless there is a medical reason not to. The evidence is clear on vacines. I am certain in under developed countrys they welcome life saving vacines.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can you explain why a virus that had been around since at least 1947 is just now causing birth defects?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Where is she going to get natural immunity  to polio and diphtheria?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hmmm only scholarly information I seem to find is decline of disease with the increase of vaccine.....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because you don't want him to get dead from a preventable disease or infection, ya doofus.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wait,  aren't they the ones making death threats to doctors and researchers,  while we're trying to keep up herd immunity so their kids don't suffer?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So, I have a question. Would the measles vaccine  cause the measles to mutate, or  the actual virus just mutate?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But at least she'll have natural immunity!! 

I mean come on, why get immunity with a simple vaccination, when you can get immunity with a great deal of suffering - if the immunity-causing disease doesn't kill you in the process?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because they don't work. That is why we need 100% vaccination rates and possibly, very profitable yearly boosters, to cocoon and herd everyone. Of course when that fails, I don't know what marginalized group they'll pick to blame at that point.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because 100 cases out if millions of people makes it an epidemic.  Idiots.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I only had my baby vaccinated against hep b as a young baby as I work in disability where hepatitis incidents are confidential.  Although I am immunised and get my boosters, there is a very small possibility that I may catch it and give it to him.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Til epidemics return they will not understand. They claim in outbreaks most of the ill are vaccinated because it lowers the immune system.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But if the vaccination is the reason why no one died of measles? Correlation,  causation...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes, adults require a booster. Everybody should get their titres checked for immunity status - simple blood test that will tell you what you are still protected against and what you are not. My titre test in 2007 revealed I was still immune to mumps and rubella, but not measles, so I had a repeat MMR.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thanks adults! Now they get to suffer as children and have a 1 in 3 chance of developing shingles as an adult.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The vast majority of unvaccinated children in the developed world will survive. They just take a higher risk and, worse, take advantage of herd immunity while weakening it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Cynthia Maurer During the 1950s, hundreds of thousands of people got measles in the USA, despite good nutrition and hygiene. 500 a year, on average, died, and another 500, on average, suffered encephalitis. Every year. Once immunization became standard practice, we got to a point where no one in the USA got measles, not one person died from it, a few people a year got encephalitis from the vaccine ( risk is much MUCH higher with actual measles) and that was it.  Severe health issues after MMR are almost nonexistent, they are so rare. Autism, sids, asthma, MS, allergies, etc, none are caused by vaccines. Now, thanks to people not vaccinating, we have had 600 cases of measles in the USA in 2014 alone.  90% in unvaccinated kids.  That is a shame. All because people believe vaccines kill and cause chronic disease, which is not true.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The measles alone vax and the MMR are both dead viruses right?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I completely get not wanting to take that risk, but then realise that every healthy child unvaccinated is a further risk to your children
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
People would do well to realise what some of the ingredients in homeopathy are. Nux vomica for instance , is strychnine.

I read a document from Midwives in Newzealand about measles statistics and the records showed that there is a measles epidemic approximately every 18 years, this has not changed since the invention of vaccinations. I cant remember any of the details of the source of the document unfortunately.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
they have all lived.... except for the ones that died from vaccine prevetable disease.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
only a complete moron would write that. what about all other unvaccinated children or other at risk people. Just have to look at deadly diseases in years past which have been eliminated by the use of vaccines.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The odds of catching a disease like measles USED to be low, before being anti vax became a "thing". ������

Is it just me or did anyone else read this as have a vagginated new year?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm just gonna have my own garden with clover and not worry about it lol
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's obviously just better sanitation at work. It's just a coincidence that this happened at the same time.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
never thought i would be able to agree with anything out of this guy's mouth.  right on!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She is right about one thing. Kohls does not care about her and her opinions.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
well the link doesn't work anymore so hopefully someone at yahoo realized how damaging this is and removed it!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Does anyone know about the grace period 63 days and can someone explain how that works does everyone get it or do I need to call someone etc

Ok. So vaccines work. Question is, what exactly do they do?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not a fan of theirs but this is a good thing they're doing
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wrong.  All of it is wrong. History ain't that hard.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why are you so worried, if vaccines work the vaccinated kids will be fine...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But initially last year they had it right, too, right?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What does this have to do with GMOs and Vaccines?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's evil. Someone should take her child away anyway since she clearly doesn't want to be a parent
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Connecting the two is ridiculous. Is she. Vegan too? Does that even matter?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Let them come to me :) I got something for them.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Weed is a legit medicine. Anyone who says otherwise has never tried it. I'm sure someone in your immediate circle has tried it or knows someone who uses it for medication. It's natural, doesn't mean it doesn't work. It's the only thing that works 100% of the time for me.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Right down the street from me. Good stuff! Enjoy your Hardees :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Does that now mean that all kids not vaxed have to have it now??
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If no one can do anything about any of this what's the point about talking about it?
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 30, '______________________________\n')
Same kid, new ridiculousness. I wouldn't let him hold the selfie stick!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Then dont breathe the air... there is arsenic in the air
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is unnecessary, there's a vaccine now, why make your kids go through that?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd probably hand her the spoon and say here you try.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
'Never worn a seat belt. Never had a car crash'.

They've forgotten the word 'YET'.

I don't know how to copy and paste yet but im curious what you guys think?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Definitely barrow all the essential oils you can get your hands on.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And then I woke up and it was all a dream........

FFS.

My god what kind of children have we raised! That would use this kind of comparison.  Totally inappropriate.  You should be ashamed.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thgis is a really tough pill to swallow.  Especially when you're only getting bits and pieces of each case.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
^^^^ I know that was wrong but I couldn't help it
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And what was Kate thinking giving birth in a hospital?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

I'd blow up her house if I ever saw it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And you wonder why you are being put on blast...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As long as you make sure you wash your hands regularly there's no need to worry about your computer catching a system crashing illness.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would make a huge copy of this and put it in her from door
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For the chemicals in clothing, can't we just wash them before letting our kids wear them?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It just makes their heads smoke and their arms flail...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
More than likely no, but you never know if you don't try.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When you take your breaks off, the other car will crash into you because they have breaks. They think it's us haha.

There is no difference between the two. Whether in vaccine or fruit, it's 2 hydrogen atoms, 1 oxygen atom bound to a carbon atom.

I actually have been hit by a car while bicycling... And I do believe it's better that cars not hit bicyclists.

If you're not wearing your seatbelt, my seatbelt is not going to work.

Just curious... Where would I get this heroin vaccine? Asking on behalf...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I know that to be true from first hand experience Rochelle.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
fine, don't make them wear seats belts. After the accidents, there will be less stupid on the road
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can't they just say "I got one" wink.....wink.... I mean, do they have to be present at the time or something?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is that a car seat? She's not safe in it!

Ad nauseum ������������
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It was nice of him to sign off with his name though :-)

Put them in a wheel"barrow" and empty it off a cliff. Can any of these people spell?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
