These findings are supported by a prospective cohort study (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23588083).

In the October 27 episode, ���All Signs Point to North,��� the Kardashian family received Tdap vaccines to protect them and baby North against pertussis (whooping cough). While I did not see the episode, it was dutifully chronicled by two pro-vaccine medical bloggers. And, apparently, when one of the Kardashian sisters tried to avoid getting the shot, she was told she could not visit the baby without it. She received the vaccination.\n",
